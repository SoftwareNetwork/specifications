<h1 id="charls">CharLS</h1>
<p>CharLS is a C++ implementation of the JPEG-LS standard for lossless and near-lossless image compression and decompression. JPEG-LS is a low-complexity image compression standard that matches JPEG 2000 compression ratios.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>C++14 library implementation with a binary C interface for maximum interoperability. Note: C++03 compatible implementation is maintained in the 1.x-master branch.</li>
<li>Supports Windows, Linux and Solaris in 32 bit and 64 bit.</li>
<li>Includes an adapter assembly for .NET based languages.</li>
<li>Excellent compression and decompression performance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="about-jpeg-ls">About JPEG-LS</h2>
<p>JPEG-LS (ISO-14495-1/ITU-T.87) is an image compression standard derived from the Hewlett Packard LOCO algorithm. JPEG-LS has low complexity (meaning fast compression) and high compression ratios, similar to the JPEG 2000 lossless ratios. JPEG-LS is more similar to the old Lossless JPEG than to JPEG 2000, but interestingly the two different techniques result in vastly different performance characteristics.

<h2 id="about-this-software">About this software</h2>
<p>This project's goal is to provide a full implementation of JPEG-LS. This library is written from scratch in portable C++. The master branch uses modern C++ v11. The 1.x branch is maintained in C++ v03. All mainstream JPEG-LS features are implemented by this library. According to preliminary test results published on http://imagecompression.info/gralic, CharLS is about <em>twice as fast</em> as the original HP code, and beats both JPEG-XR and JPEG 2000 by a factor 3.</p>
<h2 id="supported-platforms">Supported platforms</h2>
<p>The code is regularly compiled/tested on Windows and 64 bit Linux. Additionally, the code has been successfully tested on Linux Intel/AMD 32/64 bit (slackware, debian, gentoo), Solaris SPARC systems, Intel based Macs and Windows CE (ARM CPU, emulated), where the less common compilers may require minor code edits. It leverages C++ language features (templates, traits) to create optimized code, which generally perform best with recent compilers. If you compile with GCC, 64 bit code performs substantially better.</p>
<h2 id="users-acknowledgements">Users &amp; Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>CharLS is being used by <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gdcm/">gdcm dicom toolkit</a>, thanks for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/users/malat">Matthieu</a> for getting CharLS started on Linux. <a href="http://knivez.homelinux.org/">Kato Kanryu</a> wrote an initial version of the color transfroms and the DIB output format code, for an <a href="http://www.irfanview.com">irfanview</a> plugin using CharLS. Thanks to Uli Schlachter, CharLS now finally runs correctly on big-endian architectures like Sun SPARC.</p>

Be aware that Hewlett Packard claims to own patents that apply to JPEG-LS implementations, but they license it for free for conformant JPEG-LS implementations.
