<h1 id="what-is-libgpg-error">What is Libgpg-error</h1>
<p>Libgpg-error is a library that defines common error values for all
GnuPG components. Among these are GPG, GPGSM, GPGME, GPG-Agent,
libgcrypt, Libksba, DirMngr, Pinentry, SmartCard Daemon and more.
Meanwhile Libgcrypt also sports functions commonly used by all GnuPG
components and which are believed to be generally useful. The main
components are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Structured error codes and utility functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Replacement functions for stdio stream (estream) to provide a
reliable set of printf features on all platforms. For convenience macros
are provided to make migration from stdio to estream easier (ie. the
prefix “es_”)</p></li>
<li><p>Generic Mutex implementation for all platforms using an ABI
independent of the underlying implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>A lean gettext and iconv implementation for Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>Log functions</p></li>
<li><p>Option parser</p></li>
<li><p>Base-64 encoder and decoder.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More components will be added over time. Most functions are prefixed
with “gpgrt” (GnuPG Run Time) instead of “gpg_err” to indicate the long
term plan to rename this library to gpgrt.</p>

<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p>Please read the file INSTALL!</p>
<p>Here is a quick summary:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Check that you have unmodified sources. You can find instructions
how to verify the sources below. Don’t skip this - it is an important
step!</p></li>
<li><p>Unpack the archive. With GNU tar you can do it this way: “tar
xjvf libgpg-error-x.y.tar.bz2”</p></li>
<li><p>“cd libgpg-error-x.y”</p></li>
<li><p>“./configure”</p></li>
<li><p>“make”</p></li>
<li><p>“make install”</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="how-to-verify-the-source">How to Verify the Source</h1>
<p>In order to check that the version of libgpg-error which you are
going to install is an original and unmodified copy of the original, you
can do it in one of the following ways:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>If you already have a trusted version of GnuPG installed, you can
simply check the supplied signature:</p>
<p>$ gpg –verify libgpg-error-x.y.tar.bz2.sig
libgpg-error-x.y.tar.bz2</p>
<p>This checks that the detached signature libgpg-error-x.y.tar.bz2.sig
is indeed a signature of libgpg-error-x.y.tar.bz2. Make sure that the
signature has been created by a trusted keys.</p>
<p>Please note that you have to use an old version of GnuPG to do all
this stuff. <em>Never</em> use the version which was built using the
library you are trying to verify!</p></li>
<li><p>If you don’t have any a trusted version of GnuPG, you can attempt
to verify the SHA1 checksum, using a trusted version of the sha1sum
program:</p>
<p>$ sha1sum libgpg-error-x.y.tar.bz2</p>
<p>This should yield an output <em>similar</em> to this:</p>
<p>610064e5b77700f5771c8fde2691c4365e1ca100 libgpg-error-x.y.tar.bz2</p>
<p>Now check that this checksum is <em>exactly</em> the same as the one
published via the announcement list and probably via Usenet.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="hints">Hints</h1>
<p>To build for Windows you you may use the convenience command:</p>
<p>./autogen.sh –build-w32</p>
<p>which runs configure with suitable options. There is also basic
support for building a 64 bit Windows version:</p>
<p>./autogen.sh –build-w64</p>
<h1 id="cross-compiling">Cross-Compiling</h1>
<p>Libgpg-error needs to figure out some platform specific properties.
These are used to build the platform specific gpg-error.h file. The
detection is done during build time but can’t be done when
cross-compiling. Thus if you run into an error during building you need
to figure out these values. You may use these commands:</p>
<p>build=“<span
class="math inline">$(build-aux/config.guess)"  ./configure
--prefix=TARGETDIR --host=TARGET --build=$</span>build cd src make
gen-posix-lock-obj scp gen-posix-lock-obj TARGET: ssh TARGET
./gen-posix-lock-obj &gt;tmp.h mv tmp.h”syscfg/$(awk ‘NR==1 {print $2}’
tmp.h)”</p>
<p>If you are using a VPATH build adjust accordingly. If this all works
for you (make sure to run the test programs on the target platform),
please send the generated file to the gnupg-devel mailing list so that
we can include it in the next release. Note that in addition to the
aliasing done by config.sub the src/mkheader build tool does some extra
aliasing to avoid having too much identical syscfg files.</p>
<h1 id="known-problems">Known Problems</h1>
<p>On Windows, WSA Error Codes can be provided as system error codes and
will be transparently converted to the corresponding gpg error codes.
There are two problems with this support:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Not all error codes corresponding to WSA Error codes have a
detailed description when printed with gpg_strerror. Some will default
to “Unknown error” for pretty printing. For example, WSAEHOSTDOWN will
be translated to GPG_ERR_EHOSTDOWN, but there is no corresponding
EHOSTDOWN in Windows and thus gpg_strerror will default to “Unknown
error” as printed by the system’s strerror function for the argument
WSAEHOSTDOWN. (This could be fixed by adding our own error strings
replacing or extending the system error strings, including their
translations).</p></li>
<li><p>The translation to a gpg error code and back to a system error
code in some cases does not preserve information. For example, the error
code WSAEACCES translates to GPG_ERR_EACCES, which translates back to
EACCES.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Any WSA Error code has either the first problem or the second (but
not both), depending on if there is a corresponding Windows error
code.</p>
