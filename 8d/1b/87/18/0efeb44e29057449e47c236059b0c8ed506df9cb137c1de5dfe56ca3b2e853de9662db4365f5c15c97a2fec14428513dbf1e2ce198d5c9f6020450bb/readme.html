<p>This is the home for the <a href="https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/tree/master/src">MurmurHash</a> family of hash functions along with the <a href="https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/tree/master/src">SMHasher</a> test suite used to verify them. SMHasher is released under the MIT license. All MurmurHash versions are public domain software, and the author disclaims all copyright to their code.</p>
<p>SMHasher is a test suite designed to test the distribution, collision, and performance properties of non-cryptographic hash functions - it aims to be the <a href="http://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php">DieHarder</a> of hash testing, and does a pretty good job of finding flaws with a number of popular hashes.</p>
<p>The SMHasher suite also includes <a href="https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/blob/master/src/MurmurHash3.cpp">MurmurHash3</a>, which is the latest version in the series of MurmurHash functions - the new version is faster, more robust, and its variants can produce 32- and 128-bit hash values efficiently on both x86 and x64 platforms.</p>

<p>Woo, we're on Github! I've been putting off the migration for a few, uh, years or so, but hopefully Github won't be shutting down any time soon so I don't have to move things again. MurmurHash is still used all over the place, SMHasher is still the defacto hash function test suite, and there are all sorts of interesting new hash functions out there that improve bulk hashing speed and use new shiny hardware instructions for AES and whatnot. Interesting times. :)</p>
<p>I've copied the few wiki pages from code.google.com/p/smhasher to this wiki, though I haven't reformatted them to Markdown yet. The MurmurHash page on Wikipedia should also be linking here now as well. Feel free to send me pull requests.</p>
