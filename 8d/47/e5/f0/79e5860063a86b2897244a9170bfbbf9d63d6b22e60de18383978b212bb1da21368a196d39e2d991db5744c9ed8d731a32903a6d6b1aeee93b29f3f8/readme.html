<h1 id="boost.system">Boost.System</h1>
<p>The Boost.System library, part of <a href="https://boost.org">Boost
C++ Libraries</a>, implements an extensible framework for error
reporting in the form of an <code>error_code</code> class and supporting
facilities.</p>
<p>It has been proposed for the C++11 standard, has been accepted, and
is now available as part of the standard library in the
<code>&lt;system_error&gt;</code> header. However, the Boost
implementation has continued to evolve and gain enhancements and
additional functionality, such as support for attaching <a
href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/assert/doc/html/assert.html#source_location_support">source
locations</a> to <code>error_code</code>, and a
<code>result&lt;T&gt;</code> class that can carry either a value or an
error code.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://boost.org/libs/system">the documentation of
System</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Since <code>&lt;system_error&gt;</code> is a relatively undocumented
portion of the C++ standard library, the documentation of Boost.System
may be useful to you even if you use the standard components.</p>
