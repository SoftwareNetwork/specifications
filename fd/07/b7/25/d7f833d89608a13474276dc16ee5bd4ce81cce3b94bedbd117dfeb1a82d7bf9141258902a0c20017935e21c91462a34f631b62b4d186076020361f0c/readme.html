<p><a href="https://travis-ci.com/anthonywilliams/object_ptr"><img src="https://travis-ci.com/anthonywilliams/object_ptr.svg?branch=master" alt="Build Status" /></a></p>
<p>This is an implementation of a class similar to <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/observer_ptr"><code>std::experimental::observer_ptr</code></a> from the <a href="http://wg21.link/n4562">Library Fundamentals TS v2</a>, but with various improvements suggested in WG21 email discussions of the feature.</p>
<h2 id="differences-to-stdexperimentalobserver_ptr">Differences to <code>std::experimental::observer_ptr</code></h2>
<p>The most obvious change is the name: <code>observer_ptr</code> is a bad name, because it conjures up the idea of the Observer pattern, but it doesn't really &quot;observe&quot; anything. I believe <code>object_ptr</code> is better: it is a pointer to an object, so doesn't have any array-related functionality such as pointer arithmetic, but it doesn't tell you anything about ownership.</p>
<p>The most important change to functionality is that it has <strong>implicit</strong> conversions from raw pointers, <code>std::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code>. This facilitates the use of <code>jss::object_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> as a drop-in replacement for <code>T*</code> in function parameters. There is nothing you can do with a <code>jss::object_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> that you can't do with a <code>T*</code>, and in fact there is considerably less that you can do. The same applies with <code>std::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code>: you are reducing functionality, so this is safe, and reducing typing for safe operations is a good thing.</p>
<p>The other change is the removal of the <code>release()</code> member function. An <code>object_ptr</code> doesn't own anything, so it can't release ownership. To clear it, call <code>reset()</code>; if you want the wrapped pointer, call <code>get()</code> first.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<pre class="cplusplus"><code>#include &quot;object_ptr.hpp&quot;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void foo(jss::object_ptr&lt;int&gt; p) {
    if(p) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; *p;
    } else {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;(null)&quot;;
    }
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
}

int main() {
    foo(nullptr);
    int x= 42;
    foo(&amp;x);

    auto sp= std::make_shared&lt;int&gt;(123);
    foo(sp);
    auto up= std::make_unique&lt;int&gt;(456);
    foo(up);
}</code></pre>
<p>The most common expected use case is as a function parameter, as in the example above. It is similar to <code>std::string_view</code> from C++17 and <code>std::span</code> from C++20, in that it provides a view on data managed elsewhere, and we only care about accessing that data, not how it is managed. It is therefore ideally suited to places where you know the lifetime of the pointee exceeds the lifetime of the <code>object_ptr</code>. Function arguments typically provide this guarantee, but it may also be used as a class member where the pointee outlives the new class object, such as where the wrapper class object is created and destroyed within a scope, and the pointee outlives that scope.</p>
