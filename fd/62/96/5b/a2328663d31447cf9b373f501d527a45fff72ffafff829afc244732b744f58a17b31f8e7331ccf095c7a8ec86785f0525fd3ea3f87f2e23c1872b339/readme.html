<h2 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h2>
<p>Hedley is C/C++ a header file designed to smooth over some platform-specific annoyances. The idea is to get rid of a bunch of the #ifdefs in your code and put them in Hedley instead or, if you haven't bothered with platform-specific functionality in your code, to make it easier to do so. This code can be used to improve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static analysis — better warnings and errors help you catch errors before they become a real issue.</li>
<li>Optimizations — compiler hints help speed up your code.</li>
<li>Manage public APIs</li>
<li>Visibility — keeping internal symbols private can make your program faster and smaller.</li>
<li>Versioning — help consumers avoid functions which are deprecated or too new for all the platforms they want to support.</li>
<li>C/C++ interoperability — make it easier to use code in both C and C++ compilers.</li>
<li><em>… and more!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>You can safely use Hedley in your <em>public</em> API. If someone else includes a newer version of Hedley later on, the newer Hedley will just redefine everything, and if someone includes an older version it will simply be ignored.</p>
<p>It should be safe to use any of Hedley's features; if the platform doesn't support the feature it will be silently ignored.</p>
