<p>= GIFLIB =</p>
<p>This is the README file of GIFLIB, a library for manipulating GIF files.</p>
<p>Latest versions of GIFLIB are currently hosted at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/giflib</p>
<p>== Overview ==</p>
<p>GIF is a legacy format; we recommend against generating new images in it. For a cleaner, more extensible design with better color support and compression, look up PNG.</p>
<p>giflib provides code for reading GIF files and transforming them into RGB bitmaps, and for writing RGB bitmaps as GIF files.</p>
<p>The (permissive) open-source license is in the file COPYING.</p>
<p>You will find build instructions in build.asc</p>
<p>You will find full documentation of the API in doc/ and on the project website.</p>
<p>The project has a long and confusing history, described in history.asc</p>
<p>The project to-do list is in TODO.</p>
