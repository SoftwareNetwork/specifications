<h1 id="flann---fast-library-for-approximate-nearest-neighbors">FLANN - Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors</h1>
<p>FLANN is a library for performing fast approximate nearest neighbor searches in high dimensional spaces. It contains a collection of algorithms we found to work best for nearest neighbor search and a system for automatically choosing the best algorithm and optimum parameters depending on the dataset. FLANN is written in C++ and contains bindings for the following languages: C, MATLAB, Python, and Ruby.</p>
