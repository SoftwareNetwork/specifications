<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>Belle is a single header C++17 library for working with HTTP and Websockets. It utilizes the HTTP and Websocket functionalities of Boost.Beast, along with the asynchronous networking capabilities of Boost.ASIO.</p>
<p>The design goals for Belle are the following: * <strong>Intuitive API</strong>: Interactions with the library should be as straightforward and concise as that of a modern scripting language. * <strong>Reasonable Defaults</strong>: The default state of data and behaviour should be logical and expected, allowing customization when needed. * <strong>Great Performance</strong>: Speed and memory usage is important and sought after, but not at the cost of diminishing the goals listed above.</p>
<p>There are many HTTP and Websocket libraries currently available, each with their own goals and advantages. As the networking layer is often a crucial component in your program, make sure to browse around and select a library that is going to be the most beneficial for you.</p>
<p>This library is undergoing active development and is working its way towards a 1.0.0 release. Be aware that while the major version is zero, <em>0.y.z</em>, the public API should <strong>not</strong> be considered stable, and is subject to change at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Belle welcomes and encourages your thoughts and feedback!</strong></p>
<p>The following lists describe an overview of the current implemented features, along with the planned future features:</p>

<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>If Belle is installed on your system:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span class="pp">#include </span><span class="im">&lt;ob/belle.hh&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">namespace</span> Belle = OB::Belle;</code></pre></div>
<p>If Belle is copied to your project directory:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span class="pp">#include </span><span class="im">&quot;belle.hh&quot;</span>
<span class="kw">namespace</span> Belle = OB::Belle;</code></pre></div>
<p>Make sure to link the <strong>Dependencies</strong>, along with meeting the <strong>Requirements</strong> listed above.</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>The source code contains helpful comments and explanations. A detailed set of documentation and guides are planned for the future.</p>
<p>Basic documentation can be generated using Doxygen:</p>
<pre><code>$ doxygen ./.doxyfile</code></pre>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>There are several examples located in the <code>./example</code> directory. Each example has its own CMake build file, and can be built in either <strong>Debug</strong> or <strong>Release</strong> mode by passing the appropriate CMake flag, <code>-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug</code> or <code>-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release</code>. Several examples rely on relative paths, therefore, they expect to be executed from a specific path. The example programs should be executed in their respective build directory.</p>
<p>Within an examples directory, the following will build and run it in Debug mode.</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir -p ./build
$ cd ./build
$ cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
$ make
$ ./app</code></pre>
<p>The examples depend on the Belle source file in the <code>./include</code> directory. To use one of the examples as a starting point, copy the selected example to a new directory, and then follow the <strong>Install</strong> and <strong>Build</strong> instructions listed above.</p>
<h3 id="server">Server</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>hello</strong>: an HTTP server with a get endpoint, post endpoint, and static file handling</li>
<li><strong>http</strong>: a multithreaded HTTP server with multiple endpoints, static file handling, signal handling, and error handling</li>
<li><strong>https</strong>: a multithreaded HTTPS server with multiple endpoints, static file handling, signal handling, and error handling</li>
<li><strong>chat</strong>: a single threaded HTTP / Websocket chat room server with multiple endpoints, static file handling, signal handling, and error handling, with a basic html/css/js client interface</li>
<li><strong>chat-ssl</strong>: a single threaded HTTPS / Websocket Secure chat room server with multiple endpoints, static file handling, signal handling, and error handling, with a basic html/css/js client interface</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="client">Client</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>http</strong>: an HTTP client that makes multiple requests to a remote endpoint</li>
<li><strong>https</strong>: an HTTPS client that makes multiple requests to a remote endpoint</li>
</ul>
