<h1 id="pango">Pango</h1>
<p>Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis
on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is
needed; however, most of the work on Pango so far has been done using
the GTK widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text
and font handling for GTK.</p>
<p>Pango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout can be used
with different font backends. There are three basic backends, with
multiple options for rendering with each.</p>
<ul>
<li>Client-side fonts using the FreeType and FontConfig libraries.
Rendering can be with with Cairo or Xft libraries, or directly to an
in-memory buffer with no additional libraries.</li>
<li>Native fonts on Microsoft Windows. Rendering can be done via Cairo
or directly using the native Win32 API.</li>
<li>Native fonts on MacOS X with the CoreText framework, rendering via
Cairo.</li>
</ul>
<p>The integration of Pango with <a
href="https://cairographics.org">Cairo</a> provides a complete solution
with high quality text handling and graphics rendering.</p>
<p>As well as the low level layout rendering routines, Pango includes
PangoLayout, a high level driver for laying out entire blocks of text,
and routines to assist in editing internationalized text.</p>

<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
<p>Pango depends on the GLib library; more information about GLib can be
found at https://www.gtk.org/.</p>
<p>To use the Free Software stack backend, Pango depends on the
following libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.fontconfig.org">FontConfig</a> for font
discovery,</li>
<li><a href="https://www.freetype.org">FreeType</a> for font
access,</li>
<li><a href="http://www.harfbuzz.org">HarfBuzz</a> for complex text
shaping</li>
<li><a href="http://fribidi.org">fribidi</a> for bidirectional text
handling</li>
</ul>
<p>Cairo support depends on the <a
href="https://cairographics.org">Cairo</a> library. The Cairo backend is
the preferred backend to use Pango with and is subject of most of the
development in the future. It has the advantage that the same code can
be used for display and printing.</p>
<p>We suggest using Pango with Cairo as described above, but you can
also do X-specific rendering using the Xft library. The Xft backend uses
version 2 of the Xft library to manage client side fonts. Version 2 of
Xft is available from https://xlibs.freedesktop.org/release/. You’ll
need the libXft package, and possibly the libXrender and renderext
packages as well. You’ll also need FontConfig.</p>
<p>Installation of Pango on Win32 is possible, see README.win32.</p>
