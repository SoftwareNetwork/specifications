<h1 id="harfbuzz">HarfBuzz</h1>
<p>HarfBuzz is a text shaping engine. It primarily supports <a
href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/">OpenType</a>,
but also <a
href="https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/RM06/Chap6AATIntro.html">Apple
Advanced Typography</a>. HarfBuzz is used in Android, Chrome, ChromeOS,
Firefox, GNOME, GTK+, KDE, LibreOffice, OpenJDK, PlayStation, Qt, XeTeX,
and other places.</p>

<p>For tarball releases of HarfBuzz, look <a
href="https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/releases">here</a>. At the
same place you will also find Win32/Win64 binary bundles that include
libharfbuzz DLL, hb-view.exe, hb-shape.exe, and all dependencies.</p>
<p>The canonical source tree is available on <a
href="https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz">github</a>.</p>
<p>The API that comes with <code>hb.h</code> will not change
incompatibly. Other, peripheral, headers are more likely to go through
minor modifications, but again, we do our best to never change API in an
incompatible way. We will never break the ABI.</p>

<p>To get a better idea of where HarfBuzz stands in the text rendering
stack you may want to read <a href="http://behdad.org/text/">State of
Text Rendering</a>, though, that document is many years old. Here are a
few presentation slides about HarfBuzz at the Internationalization and
Unicode Conference over the years:</p>
<ul>
<li>November 2014, <a href="https://goo.gl/FSIQuC">Unicode, OpenType,
and HarfBuzz: Closing the Circle</a>,</li>

<h2 id="name">Name</h2>
<p>HarfBuzz (حرف‌باز) is my Persian translation of “<a
href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/">OpenType</a>”,
transliterated using the Latin script. It sports a second meaning, but
that ain’t translatable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Background: Originally there was this font format called TrueType.
People and companies started calling their type engines all things
ending in Type: FreeType, CoolType, ClearType, etc. And then came
OpenType, which is the successor of TrueType. So, for my OpenType
implementation, I decided to stick with the concept but use the Persian
translation. Which is fitting given that Persian is written in the
Arabic script, and OpenType is an extension of TrueType that adds
support for complex script rendering, and HarfBuzz is an implementation
of OpenType complex text shaping.</p>
