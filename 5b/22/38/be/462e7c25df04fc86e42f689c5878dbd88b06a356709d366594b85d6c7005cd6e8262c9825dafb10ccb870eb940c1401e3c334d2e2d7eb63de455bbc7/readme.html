<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>1.9.0</strong></td>
<td>Added SSE versions of quaternion operations.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>1.8.0</strong></td>
<td>Added fast vector normalization routines that use fast inverse square roots.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>1.7.1</strong></td>
<td>Changed operator[] to take a const ref int instead of an int.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>1.7.0</strong></td>
<td>Renamed the 'Rows' member of hmm_mat4 to 'Columns'. Since our matrices are column-major, this should have been named 'Columns' from the start. 'Rows' is still present, but has been deprecated.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>1.6.0</strong></td>
<td>Added array subscript operators for vector and matrix types in C++. This is provided as a convenience, but be aware that it may incur an extra function call in unoptimized builds.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>1.5.1</strong></td>
<td>Fixed a bug with uninitialized elements in HMM_LookAt.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>1.5.0</strong></td>
<td>Changed internal structure for better performance and inlining. As a result, <code>HANDMADE_MATH_NO_INLINE</code> has been removed and no longer has any effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>1.4.0</strong></td>
<td>Fixed bug when using C mode. SSE'd all vec4 operations. Removed zeroing for better performance.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>1.3.0</strong></td>
<td>Removed need to <code>#define HANDMADE_MATH_CPP_MODE</code>. C++ definitions are now included automatically in C++ environments.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>1.2.0</strong></td>
<td>Added equality functions for <code>HMM_Vec2</code>, <code>HMM_Vec3</code>, and <code>HMM_Vec4</code>, and SSE'd <code>HMM_MultiplyMat4</code> and <code>HMM_Transpose</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>1.1.5</strong></td>
<td>Added <code>Width</code> and <code>Height</code> to <code>HMM_Vec2</code>, and made it so you can supply your own <code>SqrtF</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>1.1.4</strong></td>
<td>Fixed SSE being included on platforms that don't support it, and fixed divide-by-zero errors when normalizing zero vectors.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>1.1.3</strong></td>
<td>Fixed compile error in C mode</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>1.1.2</strong></td>
<td>Fixed invalid HMMDEF's in the function definitions</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>1.1.1</strong></td>
<td>Resolved compiler warnings on gcc and g++</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>1.1</strong></td>
<td>Quaternions!</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>1.0</strong></td>
<td>Lots of testing</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>0.7</strong></td>
<td>Added HMM_Vec2, and HMM_Vec4 versions of HMM_LengthSquared, HMM_Length, and HMM_Normalize.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>0.6</strong></td>
<td>Made HMM_Power faster, Fixed possible efficiency problem with HMM_Normalize, RENAMED HMM_LengthSquareRoot to HMM_LengthSquared, RENAMED HMM_RSqrtF to HMM_RSquareRootF, RENAMED HMM_SqrtF to HMM_SquareRootF, REMOVED Inner function (user should use Dot now), REMOVED HMM_FastInverseSquareRoot function declaration</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>0.5.2</strong></td>
<td>Fixed SSE code in HMM_SqrtF and HMM_RSqrtF</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>0.5.1</strong></td>
<td>Fixed HMM_Translate producing row-major matrices, ensured column-major order for matrices throughout</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>0.5</strong></td>
<td>Added scalar operations on vectors and matrices, added += and -= for hmm_mat4, reconciled headers and implementations, tidied up in general</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>0.4</strong></td>
<td>Added SSE Optimized HMM_SqrtF, HMM_RSqrtF, Removed use of C Runtime</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>0.3</strong></td>
<td>Added +=,-=, *=, /= for hmm_vec2, hmm_vec3, hmm_vec4</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>0.2b</strong></td>
<td>Disabled warning C4201 on MSVC, Added 64bit percision on HMM_PI</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>0.2a</strong></td>
<td>Prefixed Macros</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>0.2</strong></td>
<td>Updated Documentation, Fixed C Compliance, Prefixed all functions, and added better operator overloading</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>0.1</strong></td>
<td>Initial Version</td>
