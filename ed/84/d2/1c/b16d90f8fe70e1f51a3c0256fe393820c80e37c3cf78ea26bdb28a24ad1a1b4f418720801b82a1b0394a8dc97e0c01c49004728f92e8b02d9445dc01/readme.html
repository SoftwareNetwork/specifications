<p>JUCE is an open-source cross-platform C++ application framework for
creating desktop and mobile applications, including VST, VST3, AU, AUv3,
AAX and LV2 audio plug-ins and plug-in hosts. JUCE can be easily
integrated with existing projects via CMake, or can be used as a project
generation tool via the <a href="#the-projucer">Projucer</a>, which
supports exporting projects for Xcode (macOS and iOS), Visual Studio,
Android Studio, and Linux Makefiles as well as containing a source code
editor.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>The JUCE repository contains a <a
href="https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/tree/master">master</a> and
<a
href="https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/tree/develop">develop</a>
branch. The develop branch contains the latest bug fixes and features
and is periodically merged into the master branch in stable <a
href="https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/releases">tagged
releases</a> (the latest release containing pre-built binaries can be
also downloaded from the <a href="https://juce.com/get-juce">JUCE
website</a>).</p>
<p>JUCE projects can be managed with either the Projucer (JUCE’s own
project-configuration tool) or with CMake.</p>
<h3 id="the-projucer">The Projucer</h3>
<p>The repository doesn’t contain a pre-built Projucer so you will need
to build it for your platform - Xcode, Visual Studio and Linux Makefile
projects are located in <a
href="/extras/Projucer/Builds">extras/Projucer/Builds</a> (the minimum
system requirements are listed in the <a
href="#minimum-system-requirements">minimum system requirements</a>
section below). The Projucer can then be used to create new JUCE
projects, view tutorials and run examples. It is also possible to
include the JUCE modules source code in an existing project directly, or
build them into a static or dynamic library which can be linked into a
project.</p>
<p>For further help getting started, please refer to the JUCE <a
href="https://juce.com/learn/documentation">documentation</a> and <a
href="https://juce.com/learn/tutorials">tutorials</a>.</p>
<h3 id="cmake">CMake</h3>
<p>Version 3.22 or higher is required. To use CMake, you will need to
install it, either from your system package manager or from the <a
href="https://cmake.org/download/">official download page</a>. For
comprehensive documentation on JUCE’s CMake API, see the <a
href="/docs/CMake%20API.md">JUCE CMake documentation</a>. For examples
which may be useful as starting points for new CMake projects, see the
<a href="/examples/CMake">CMake examples directory</a>.</p>
<h4 id="building-examples">Building Examples</h4>
<p>To use CMake to build the examples and extras bundled with JUCE,
simply clone JUCE and then run the following commands, replacing
“DemoRunner” with the name of the target you wish to build.</p>
<pre><code>cd /path/to/JUCE
cmake . -B cmake-build -DJUCE_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DJUCE_BUILD_EXTRAS=ON
cmake --build cmake-build --target DemoRunner</code></pre>

<h2 id="aax-plug-ins">AAX Plug-Ins</h2>
<p>AAX plug-ins need to be digitally signed using PACE Anti-Piracy’s
signing tools before they will run in commercially available versions of
Pro Tools. These tools are provided free of charge by Avid. Before
obtaining the signing tools, you will need to use a special build of Pro
Tools, called Pro Tools Developer, to test your unsigned plug-ins. The
steps to obtain Pro Tools Developer are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sign up as an AAX Developer <a
href="https://developer.avid.com/aax/">here</a>.</li>
<li>Request a Pro Tools Developer Bundle activation code by sending an
email to <a href="mailto:devauth@avid.com">devauth@avid.com</a>.</li>
<li>Download the latest Pro Tools Developer build from your Avid
Developer account.</li>
</ol>
<p>When your plug-ins have been tested and debugged in Pro Tools
Developer, and you are ready to digitally sign them, please send an
email to <a href="mailto:audiosdk@avid.com">audiosdk@avid.com</a> with
the subject “PACE Eden Signing Tools Request”. You need to include an
overview of each plug-in along with a screen recording showing the
plug-in running in Pro Tools Developer, with audio if possible.</p>
<p>Please also include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company name</li>
<li>Admin full name</li>
<li>Telephone number</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the request is submitted, PACE Anti-Piracy will contact you
directly with information about signing your plug-ins. When the plug-ins
have been signed, you are free to sell and distribute them. If you are
interested in selling your plug-ins on the Avid Marketplace, please send
an email to <a
href="mailto:audiosdk@avid.com">audiosdk@avid.com</a>.</p>
