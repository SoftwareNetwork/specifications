<p>Turf is a configurable C++ platform adapter. It defines a common API for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thread creation</li>
<li>Thread affinities</li>
<li>Thread IDs</li>
<li>Atomic operations</li>
<li>Mutexes</li>
<li>Condition variables</li>
<li>Read-write locks</li>
<li>Semaphores</li>
<li>Events</li>
<li>Timers</li>
<li>Virtual memory</li>
<li>Heap allocators</li>
<li>Asserts</li>
</ul>
<p>It then implements those things using POSIX, Win32, Mach, Linux, Boost, C++11 and possibly other platform APIs. You configure Turf to use the API you want.</p>
<p>Turf is used by <a href="https://github.com/preshing/junction">Junction</a>, a library of concurrent data structures in C++.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-use-c11">Why Not Use C++11?</h2>
<p>Junction was originally developed in C++11, but quickly ran into various limitations. Turf was written to address those limitations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Turf exposes affinities, integer thread IDs, semaphores and a few other things that C++11 does not.</li>
<li>Turf is configurable, so you can compare implementations and even provide your own. The standard C++11 library is not configurable.</li>
<li>Turf atomics have more flexible initialization, copy and cast rules than C++11 atomics.</li>
<li>Turf can be used by developers who don’t have access to a C++11 compiler.</li>
</ul>
