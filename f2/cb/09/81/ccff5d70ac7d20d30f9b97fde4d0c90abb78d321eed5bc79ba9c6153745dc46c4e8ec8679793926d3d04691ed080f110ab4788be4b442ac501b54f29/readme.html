<p>This is libzip, a C library for reading, creating, and modifying zip archives. Files can be added from data buffers, files, or compressed data copied directly from other zip archives. Changes made without closing the archive can be reverted. Decryption and encryption of Winzip AES and decryption of legacy PKware encrypted files is supported. The API is documented by man pages.</p>
<p>For more information, take a look at the included man pages. You can start with <a href="https://libzip.org/documentation/libzip.html">libzip(3)</a>, which lists all others. Example source code is in the <a href="examples" class="uri">examples</a> and <a href="src" class="uri">src</a> subdirectories.</p>
<p>If you have developed an application using libzip, you can find out about API changes and how to adapt your code for them in the included file <a href="API-CHANGES.md" class="uri">API-CHANGES.md</a>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="INSTALL.md" class="uri">INSTALL.md</a> file for installation instructions and dependencies.</p>
