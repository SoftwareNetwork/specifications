<p>CallableTraits is a standalone C++11 header-only library for the
inspection, synthesis, and decomposition of callable types. Language
features added in later C++ standards are also supported.</p>
<p>The latest documentation is available <a
href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/master/libs/callable_traits/doc/html/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>CallableTraits is released as part of the <a
href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost C++ Libraries</a>. Since it only
depends on the standard library headers, you can also download it as a
standalone library <a
href="https://github.com/boostorg/callable_traits/releases/latest">here</a>.</p>
