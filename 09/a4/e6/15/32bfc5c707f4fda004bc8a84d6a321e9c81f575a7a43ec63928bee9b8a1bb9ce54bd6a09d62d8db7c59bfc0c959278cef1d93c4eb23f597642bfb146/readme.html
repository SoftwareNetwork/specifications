<h1 id="windows-driver-frameworks">Windows Driver Frameworks</h1>
<p>The Windows Driver Frameworks (WDF) are a set of libraries that make
it simple to write high-quality device drivers.</p>
<h2 id="goals-for-this-project">Goals for this project</h2>
<p>Developers can use the MSDN reference documentation to learn about
the core concepts of WDF and the APIs available for use. Still, there’s
no substitute for actual source code. That’s why we’ve published the
source behind KMDF and UMDF v2 for anyone to dig through and debug
drivers with.</p>
<h3 id="learning-from-the-source">Learning from the source</h3>
<p>Unsure about what a particular WDF method is doing? Take a look at
the source. Our aim is to make the inner workings of WDF as transparent
for developers as possible.</p>
<p><em>Note: As you experiment with WDF, you may come across
undocumented behavior or APIS. We strongly advise against taking
dependencies on that behavior as it’s subject to change in future
releases.</em></p>
<h3 id="debugging-with-the-framework">Debugging with the framework</h3>
<p>Using the source in this repo, developers can perform step-through
debugging into the WDF source. This makes it much easier to follow
driver activity, understand interactions with the framework, and
diagnose issues. Debugging can be done live by hooking onto a running
driver or after a crash by analyzing the dump file. See the <a
href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Driver-Frameworks/wiki/Debugging-with-WDF-Source">debugging
page</a> in the wiki for instructions.</p>
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>With this initial release, we’ve published the source behind KMDF and
UMDF v2. You’ll find that a great deal of the source is shared between
the two. Driving the frameworks forward with a unified model is a key
priority for the WDF team.</p>
