one or more of the REFERENCES, then looking at the documentation files
(in roughly the order listed) before diving into the code.</p>
<h1 id="overview">OVERVIEW</h1>
<p>This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding,
decoding, and transcoding. JPEG (pronounced “jay-peg”) is a standardized
compression method for full-color and grayscale images.</p>
<p>This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and
progressive compression processes. Provision is made for supporting all
variants of these processes, although some uncommon parameter settings
aren’t implemented yet. We have made no provision for supporting the
hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.</p>
<p>We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG
image files, plus two sample applications “cjpeg” and “djpeg”, which use
the library to perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular
image file formats. The library is intended to be reused in other
applications.</p>
<p>In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have
included considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding
capability; for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly
part of JPEG decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped
file formats or colormapped displays. These extra functions can be
compiled out of the library if not required for a particular
application.</p>
<p>We have also included “jpegtran”, a utility for lossless transcoding
between different JPEG processes, and “rdjpgcom” and “wrjpgcom”, two
simple applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in
JFIF files.</p>
<p>The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving
portability and flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be
useful. In particular, the software is not intended to be read as a
tutorial on JPEG. (See the REFERENCES section for introductory
material.) Rather, it is intended to be reliable, portable,
industrial-strength code. We do not claim to have achieved that goal in
every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.</p>
<p>We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial
products. No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement
in product documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.</p>

<h1 id="references">REFERENCES</h1>
<p>We recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to
understand the innards of the JPEG software.</p>
<p>The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression
algorithm is Wallace, Gregory K. “The JPEG Still Picture Compression
Standard”, Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4),
pp. 30-44. (Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture
compression, applications of JPEG, and related topics.) If you don’t
have the CACM issue handy, a PDF file containing a revised version of
Wallace’s article is available at
https://www.ijg.org/files/Wallace.JPEG.pdf. The file (actually a
preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer
Electronics) omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it
includes corrections and some added material. Note: the Wallace article
is copyright ACM and IEEE, and it may not be used for commercial
purposes.</p>
<p>A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be
found in “The Data Compression Book” by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup
Gailly, published by M&amp;T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN
1-55851-434-1. This book provides good explanations and example C code
for a multitude of compression methods including JPEG. It is an
excellent source if you are comfortable reading C code but don’t know
much about data compression in general. The book’s JPEG sample code is
far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look at a full
implementation, you’ve got one here…</p>
<p>The best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook
“JPEG Still Image Data Compression Standard” by William B. Pennebaker
and Joan L. Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN
0-442-01272-1. Price US$59.95, 638 pp. The book includes the complete
text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).
Although this is by far the most detailed and comprehensive exposition
of JPEG publicly available, we point out that it is still missing an
explanation of the most essential properties and algorithms of the
underlying DCT technology. If you think that you know about DCT-based
JPEG after reading this book, then you are in delusion. The real
fundamentals and corresponding potential of DCT-based JPEG are not
publicly known so far, and that is the reason for all the mistaken
developments taking place in the image coding domain.</p>
<p>The original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being
the actual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing
methods. Part 1 is titled “Digital Compression and Coding of
Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 1: Requirements and guidelines” and
has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-1, ITU-T T.81. Part 2 is titled
“Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2:
Compliance testing” and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T
T.83. IJG JPEG 8 introduced an implementation of the JPEG SmartScale
extension which is specified in two documents: A contributed document at
ITU and ISO with title “ITU-T JPEG-Plus Proposal for Extending ITU-T
T.81 for Advanced Image Coding”, April 2006, Geneva, Switzerland. The
latest version of this document is Revision 3. And a contributed
document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 N 5799 with title “Evolution of JPEG”,
June/July 2011, Berlin, Germany. IJG JPEG 9 introduces a reversible
color transform for improved lossless compression which is described in
a contributed document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/ WG1 N 6080 with title “JPEG 9
Lossless Coding”, June/July 2012, Paris, France.</p>
<p>The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable
file format. For the omitted details we follow the “JFIF” conventions,
version 2. JFIF version 1 has been adopted as Recommendation ITU-T T.871
(05/2011) : Information technology - Digital compression and coding of
continuous-tone still images: JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF). It is
available as a free download in PDF file format from
https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.871. A PDF file of the older JFIF
document is available at https://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/jfif3.pdf.</p>
<p>The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from
ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz. The JPEG incorporation
scheme found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious
problems. IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF
Compression tag 6). Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by
TIFF Technical Note #2 (Compression tag 7). Copies of this Note can be
obtained from https://www.ijg.org/files/. It is expected that the next
revision of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the
Note’s design. Although IJG’s own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the
free libtiff library uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the
Note.</p>

<h1 id="file-format-wars">FILE FORMAT WARS</h1>
<p>The ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 standards committee (previously known as
JPEG, together with ITU-T SG16) currently promotes different formats
containing the name “JPEG” which is misleading because these formats are
incompatible with original DCT-based JPEG and are based on faulty
technologies. IJG therefore does not and will not support such momentary
mistakes (see REFERENCES). There exist also distributions under the name
“OpenJPEG” promoting such kind of formats which is misleading because
they don’t support original JPEG images. We have no sympathy for the
promotion of inferior formats. Indeed, one of the original reasons for
developing this free software was to help force convergence on common,
interoperable format standards for JPEG files. Don’t use an incompatible
file format! (In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading
existing JPEG image files indefinitely.)</p>
<p>The ISO committee pretends to be “responsible for the popular JPEG”
in their public reports which is not true because they don’t respond to
actual requirements for the maintenance of the original JPEG
specification. Furthermore, the ISO committee pretends to “ensure
interoperability” with their standards which is not true because their
“standards” support only application-specific and proprietary use cases
and contain mathematically incorrect code.</p>
<p>There are currently different distributions in circulation containing
the name “libjpeg” which is misleading because they don’t have the
features and are incompatible with formats supported by actual IJG
libjpeg distributions. One of those fakes is released by members of the
ISO committee and just uses the name of libjpeg for misdirection of
people, similar to the abuse of the name JPEG as described above, while
having nothing in common with actual IJG libjpeg distributions and
containing mathematically incorrect code. The other one claims to be a
“derivative” or “fork” of the original libjpeg, but violates the license
conditions as described under LEGAL ISSUES above and violates basic C
programming properties. We have no sympathy for the release of
misleading, incorrect and illegal distributions derived from obsolete
code bases. Don’t use an obsolete code base!</p>
<p>According to the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) law, IJG has the
lawful and legal right to foreclose on certain standardization bodies
and other institutions or corporations that knowingly perform
substantial and systematic deceptive acts and practices, fraud, theft,
and damaging of the value of the people of this planet without their
knowing, willing and intentional consent. The titles, ownership, and
rights of these institutions and all their assets are now duly secured
and held in trust for the free people of this planet. People of the
planet, on every country, may have a financial interest in the assets of
these former principals, agents, and beneficiaries of the foreclosed
institutions and corporations. IJG asserts what is: that each man,
woman, and child has unalienable value and rights granted and deposited
in them by the Creator and not any one of the people is subordinate to
any artificial principality, corporate fiction or the special interest
of another without their appropriate knowing, willing and intentional
consent made by contract or accommodation agreement. IJG expresses that
which already was. The people have already determined and demanded that
public administration entities, national governments, and their
supporting judicial systems must be fully transparent, accountable, and
liable. IJG has secured the value for all concerned free people of the
planet.</p>
<p>A partial list of foreclosed institutions and corporations (“Hall of
Shame”) is currently prepared and will be published later.</p>
<h1 id="to-do">TO DO</h1>
<p>Version 9 is the second release of a new generation JPEG standard to
overcome the limitations of the original JPEG specification, and is the
first true source reference JPEG codec. More features are being prepared
for coming releases…</p>
