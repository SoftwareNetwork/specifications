<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>GnuPG Made Easy (GPGME) is a C language library that allows to add support for cryptography to a program. It is designed to make access to public key crypto engines like GnuPG or GpgSM easier for applications. GPGME provides a high-level crypto API for encryption, decryption, signing, signature verification and key management.</p>
<p>GPGME comes with language bindings for Common Lisp, C++, QT, Python2, and Python 3.</p>
<p>GPGME uses GnuPG as its backend to support OpenPGP and the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).</p>
<p>See the files COPYING, COPYING.LESSER, and each file for copyright and warranty information. The file AUTHORS has a list of authors and useful web and mail addresses.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>See the file INSTALL for generic installation instructions.</p>
<p>Check that you have unmodified sources. See below on how to do this. Don't skip it - this is an important step!</p>
<p>To build GPGME, you need to install libgpg-error (&gt;= 1.24) and Libassuan (&gt;= 2.4.2).</p>
<p>For support of the OpenPGP and the CMS protocols, you should use the latest version of GnuPG (&gt;= 2.1.18) , available at: https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/gnupg/.</p>
<p>For building the Git version of GPGME please see the file README.GIT for more information.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-verify-the-source">How to Verify the Source</h2>
<p>In order to check that the version of GPGME which you are going to install is an original and unmodified one, you can do it in one of the following ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>If you have a trusted Version of GnuPG installed, you can simply check the supplied signature:</p>
<p>$ gpg --verify gpgme-x.y.z.tar.gz.sig gpgme-x.y.z.tar.gz</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This checks that the detached signature gpgme-x.y.z.tar.gz.sig is indeed a a signature of gpgme-x.y.z.tar.gz. The key used to create this signature is at least one of:</p>

<p>The keys are available at <a href="https://gnupg.org/signature_key.html" class="uri">https://gnupg.org/signature_key.html</a> and in released GnuPG tarballs in the file g10/distsigkey.gpg . You have to make sure that these are really the desired keys and not faked one. You should do this by comparing the fingerprints with the fingerprints published elsewhere.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>If you don't have any of the above programs, you have to verify the SHA1 checksum:</p>
<p>$ sha1sum gpgme-x.y.z.tar.gz</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This should yield an output <em>similar</em> to this:</p>
<p>fd9351b26b3189c1d577f0970f9dcadc3412def1 gpgme-x.y.z.tar.gz</p>
<p>Now check that this checksum is <em>exactly</em> the same as the one published via the announcement list and probably via Usenet.</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>For information how to use the library you can read the info manual, which is also a reference book, in the doc/ directory. The programs in the tests/ directory may also prove useful.</p>
<p>Please subscribe to the gnupg-devel@gnupg.org mailing list if you want to do serious work.</p>
