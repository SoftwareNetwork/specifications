<p>This is the liburing library. liburing provides helpers to setup and teardown io_uring instances, and also a simplified interface for applications that don't need (or want) to deal with the full kernel side implementation.</p>
<p>For more info on io_uring, please see:</p>

<p>io_uring accounts memory it needs under the rlimit memlocked option, which can be quite low on some setups (64K). The default is usually enough for most use cases, but bigger rings or things like registered buffers deplete it quickly. root isn't under this restriction, but regular users are. Going into detail on how to bump the limit on various systems is beyond the scope of this little blurb, but check /etc/security/limits.conf for user specific settings, or /etc/systemd/user.conf and /etc/systemd/system.conf for systemd setups.</p>
