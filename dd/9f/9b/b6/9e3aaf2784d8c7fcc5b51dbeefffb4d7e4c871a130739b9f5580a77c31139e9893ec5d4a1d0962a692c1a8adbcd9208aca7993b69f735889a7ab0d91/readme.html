<h2 id="readme---fast-light-tool-kit-fltk-version-1.3.5">README - Fast Light Tool Kit (FLTK) Version 1.3.5</h2>
<p>WHAT IS FLTK?</p>
<pre><code>The Fast Light Tool Kit (&quot;FLTK&quot;, pronounced &quot;fulltick&quot;) is a
a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for UNIX(r)/Linux(r) (X11),
Microsoft(r) Windows(r), and MacOS(r) X. FLTK provides
modern GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D
graphics via OpenGL(r) and its built-in GLUT emulation. It
was originally developed by Mr. Bill Spitzak and is
currently maintained by a small group of developers across
the world with a central repository in the US.</code></pre>
<p>LICENSING</p>
<pre><code>FLTK comes with complete free source code. FLTK is available
under the terms of the GNU Library General Public License.
Contrary to popular belief, it can be used in commercial
software! (Even Bill Gates could use it.)</code></pre>
<p>ON-LINE DOCUMENTATION</p>
<pre><code>Documentation is available online in HTML form and can be
downloaded as separate distribution tarballs. A PDF version of
this documentation is also available from the FLTK web site at:

    https://www.fltk.org/documentation.php</code></pre>
<p>BUILDING AND INSTALLING FLTK UNDER UNIX AND Mac OS X</p>
<pre><code>In most cases you can just type &quot;make&quot;.  This will run
configure with the default (no) options and then compile
everything.

FLTK uses GNU autoconf to configure itself for your UNIX
platform. The main things that the configure script will
look for are the X11, OpenGL (or Mesa), and JPEG header and
library files.  Make sure that they are in the standard
include/library locations.  If they aren&#39;t you need to
define the CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and LDFLAGS environment
variables.

If you aren&#39;t using &quot;gcc&quot;, &quot;g++&quot;, &quot;c++&quot;, or &quot;CC&quot; for your
C++ compiler, you&#39;ll also need to set the CXX environment
variable. Similarly, if you aren&#39;t using &quot;gcc&quot; or &quot;cc&quot; for
your C compiler you&#39;ll need to set the CC environment
variable.

You can run configure yourself to get the exact setup you
need. Type &quot;./configure &lt;options&gt;&quot;.  Options include:

--enable-cygwin         - Enable the Cygwin libraries (WIN32)
--enable-debug          - Enable debugging code &amp; symbols
--disable-gl            - Disable OpenGL support
--enable-shared         - Enable generation of shared libraries
--enable-threads        - Enable multithreading support
--enable-xdbe           - Enable the X double-buffer extension
--enable-xft            - Enable the Xft library (anti-aliased fonts)

--bindir=/path          - Set the location for executables
                          [default = /usr/local/bin]
--libdir=/path          - Set the location for libraries
                          [default = /usr/local/lib]
--includedir=/path      - Set the location for include files.
                          [default = /usr/local/include]
--prefix=/dir           - Set the directory prefix for files
                          [default = /usr/local]

When the configure script is done you can just run the
&quot;make&quot; command. This will build the library, FLUID tool, and
all of the test programs.

To install the library, become root and type &quot;make
install&quot;.  This will copy the &quot;fluid&quot; executable to
&quot;bindir&quot;, the header files to &quot;includedir&quot;, and the library
files to &quot;libdir&quot;.

To install additional files and icons to be used by the main
desktop environments such as KDE, GNOME and XFCE, you will also
need to run &quot;make install-desktop&quot; as root.</code></pre>
<p>GIT USERS</p>
<pre><code>If you&#39;ve just checked out a fresh copy of FLTK from Git (GitHub),
you&#39;ll need to generate an initial version of &#39;configure&#39;
by running &#39;make makeinclude&#39;. (We don&#39;t include a copy
of configure in git.)</code></pre>
<p>MAKE TARGETS</p>
<pre><code>make            -- builds the library + test programs (does not install)
make install    -- builds and installs
make clean      -- clean for a rebuild
make distclean  -- like &#39;clean&#39;, but also removes docs, configure, fltk-config
( cd src; make ) -- builds just the fltk libraries</code></pre>
<p>BUILDING FLTK UNDER MICROSOFT WINDOWS</p>
<pre><code>There are two ways to build FLTK under Microsoft Windows.
The first is to use the Visual C++ project files under the
&quot;ide/&quot; directory.  See the file ide/README.IDE for more info.

The second method is to use a GNU-based development tool.
To build with the Cygwin or MinGW tools, use the supplied
configure script as specified in the UNIX section above:

    sh configure ...options...</code></pre>
<p>BUILDING HTML DOCUMENTATION</p>
<pre><code>If you want to build the HTML documentation:

    ( cd documentation &amp;&amp; make html )

If you want to build the PDF documentation:

    ( cd documentation &amp;&amp; make pdf )

FLTK uses doxygen for documentation, so you&#39;ll at least need doxygen
installed for creating html docs, and LaTeX for creating PDF docs.</code></pre>
<p>INTERNET RESOURCES</p>
<pre><code>FLTK is available on the &#39;net in a bunch of locations:
