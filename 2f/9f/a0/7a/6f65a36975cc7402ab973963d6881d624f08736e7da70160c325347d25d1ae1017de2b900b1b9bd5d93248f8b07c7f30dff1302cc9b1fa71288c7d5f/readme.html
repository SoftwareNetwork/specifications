<h1 id="google-apis">Google APIs</h1>
<p>This repository contains the original interface definitions of public
Google APIs that support both REST and gRPC protocols. Reading the
original interface definitions can provide a better understanding of
Google APIs and help you to utilize them more efficiently. You can also
use these definitions with open source tools to generate client
libraries, documentation, and other artifacts.</p>
<h2 id="building">Building</h2>
<h3 id="bazel">Bazel</h3>
<p>The recommended way to build the API client libraries is through <a
href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> &gt;= 4.2.2.</p>
<p>First, <a
href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html">install
bazel</a>.</p>
<p>To build all libraries:</p>
<pre><code>bazel build //...</code></pre>
<p>To test all libraries:</p>
<pre><code>bazel test //...</code></pre>
<p>To build one library in all languages:</p>
<pre><code>bazel build //google/example/library/v1/...</code></pre>
<p>To build the Java package for one library:</p>
<pre><code>bazel build //google/example/library/v1:google-cloud-library-v1-java</code></pre>
<p>Bazel packages exist in all the libraries for Java, Go, Python, Ruby,
Node.js, PHP and C#.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Google APIs are typically deployed as API services that are hosted
under different DNS names. One API service may implement multiple APIs
and multiple versions of the same API.</p>
<p>Google APIs use <a href="https://github.com/google/protobuf">Protocol
Buffers</a> version 3 (proto3) as their Interface Definition Language
(IDL) to define the API interface and the structure of the payload
messages. The same interface definition is used for both REST and RPC
versions of the API, which can be accessed over different wire
protocols.</p>
<p>There are several ways of accessing Google APIs:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>JSON over HTTP: You can access all Google APIs directly using
JSON over HTTP, using <a
href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library">Google API
client library</a> or third-party API client libraries.</p></li>
<li><p>Protocol Buffers over gRPC: You can access Google APIs published
in this repository through <a href="https://github.com/grpc">GRPC</a>,
which is a high-performance binary RPC protocol over HTTP/2. It offers
many useful features, including request/response multiplex and
full-duplex streaming.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/cloud-client-libraries">Google
Cloud Client Libraries</a>: You can use these libraries to access Google
Cloud APIs. They are based on gRPC for better performance and provide
idiomatic client surface for better developer experience.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="discussions">Discussions</h2>
<p>This repo contains copies of Google API definitions and related
files. For discussions or to raise issues about <a
href="https://github.com/googleapis">Google API client libraries</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/grpc">GRPC</a> or <a
href="https://github.com/googlecloudplatform">Google Cloud Client
Libraries</a> please refer to the repos associated with each area.</p>
<h2 id="repository-structure">Repository Structure</h2>
<p>This repository uses a directory hierarchy that reflects the Google
API product structure. In general, every API has its own root directory,
and each major version of the API has its own subdirectory. The proto
package names exactly match the directory: this makes it easy to locate
the proto definitions and ensures that the generated client libraries
have idiomatic namespaces in most programming languages. Alongside the
API directories live the configuration files for the <a
href="https://github.com/googleapis/toolkit">GAPIC toolkit</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The major version of an API is used to
indicate breaking change to the API.</p>
<h2 id="generate-grpc-source-code">Generate gRPC Source Code</h2>
<p>To generate gRPC source code for Google APIs in this repository, you
first need to install both Protocol Buffers and gRPC on your local
machine, then you can run <code>make LANGUAGE=xxx all</code> to generate
the source code. You need to integrate the generated source code into
your application build system.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Makefile is only intended to generate
source code for the entire repository. It is not for generating linkable
client library for a specific API. Please see other repositories under
https://github.com/googleapis for generating linkable client
libraries.</p>
<h3 id="go-grpc-source-code">Go gRPC Source Code</h3>
<p>It is difficult to generate Go gRPC source code from this repository,
since Go has different directory structure. Please use <a
href="https://github.com/google/go-genproto">this repository</a>
instead.</p>
