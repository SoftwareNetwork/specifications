<h1 id="pcg-random-number-generation-c-edition">PCG Random Number Generation, C Edition</h1>
<p>This code provides an implementation of the PCG family of random number generators, which are fast, statistically excellent, and offer a number of useful features.</p>
<p>Full details can be found at the <a href="http://www.pcg-random.org">PCG-Random website</a>. This version of the code provides many family members -- if you just want one simple generator, you may prefer the minimal version of the library.</p>
<p>There are two APIs, a low-level one which explicitly names the output functions, and a higher-level one (which maps directly to the low-level code). Generally, you should use the high-level API.</p>
<h2 id="documentation-and-examples">Documentation and Examples</h2>
<p>Visit <a href="http://www.pcg-random.org">PCG-Random website</a> for information on how to use this library, or look at the sample code in the <code>sample</code> directory -- hopefully it should be fairly self explanatory.</p>
<h2 id="building">Building</h2>
<p>The code is written in C99-style C with no significant platform dependencies. On a Unix-style system (e.g., Linux, Mac OS X) you should be able to just type type</p>
<pre><code>make</code></pre>
<p>Almost all the real code is in <code>include/pcg_variants.h</code>. Because the individual RNGs have a very small amount of code, they are provided as inline functions to allow the compiler the option of inlining them. But because C requires there to also be an external definition, the <code>src</code> directory contains code to build <code>libpcg_random.a</code> which provides non-inline definitions for all the PCG generators.</p>
<p>On other systems, it should be straightforward to build a library by compiling the files in the src directory. Or, write your own file giving an <code>extern</code> declaration for every function you actually use.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>Run</p>
<pre><code>make test</code></pre>
<h2 id="directory-structure">Directory Structure</h2>
<p>The directories are arranged as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>include</code> -- contains <code>pcg_variants.h</code></li>
<li><code>src</code> -- code to define external versions of the inline functions from <code>pcg_variants.h</code> plus all the <code>_advance_r</code> functions.</li>
<li><code>test-low</code> -- test code for the low-level API where the functions have long scary-looking names</li>
<li><code>test-high</code> -- test code for the high-level API where the functions have shorter, less scary-looking names.</li>
<li><code>extras</code> -- other useful code, such as code to read /dev/random</li>
<li><code>sample</code> -- sample code, similar to the code in <code>test-high</code> but more human readable</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bit-math">128-bit Math</h2>
<p>On systems that support it (64-bit systems using GCC or Clang), the library provides RNGs that use 128-bit intger math. These generators produce 64-bit output (or more) and have a period of 2^128.</p>
<p>If you don't have 128-bit support on your system, you aren't losing that much. Thanks to the 2^63 random streams/sequences, you can gang together multiple 32-bit generators. (Note: This approach <em>would not work</em> well with generators that only have a single stream/sequence). Example code is provided in <code>sample/pcg32x2-demo.c</code>.</p>
<p>The C++ implementation provides 128-bit integers even on systems that don't natively support it, but doing so would be too much trouble in C.</p>
