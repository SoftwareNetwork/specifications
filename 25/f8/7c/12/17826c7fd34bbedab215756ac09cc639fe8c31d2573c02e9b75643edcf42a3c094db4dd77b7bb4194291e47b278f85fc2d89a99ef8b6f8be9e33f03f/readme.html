<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>GLFW is an Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan application development. It provides a simple, platform-independent API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, reading input, handling events, etc.</p>
<p>GLFW natively supports Windows, macOS and Linux and other Unix-like systems. On Linux both X11 and Wayland are supported.</p>
<p>GLFW is licensed under the <a href="https://www.glfw.org/license.html">zlib/libpng license</a>.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.glfw.org/download.html">download</a> the latest stable release as source or Windows binaries, or fetch the <code>latest</code> branch from GitHub. Each release starting with 3.0 also has a corresponding <a href="https://github.com/glfw/glfw/releases">annotated tag</a> with source and binary archives.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/">documentation</a> is available online and is included in all source and binary archives. See the <a href="https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/news.html">release notes</a> for new features, caveats and deprecations in the latest release. For more details see the <a href="https://www.glfw.org/changelog.html">version history</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>master</code> branch is the stable integration branch and <em>should</em> always compile and run on all supported platforms, although details of newly added features may change until they have been included in a release. New features and many bug fixes live in <a href="https://github.com/glfw/glfw/branches/all">other branches</a> until they are stable enough to merge.</p>
<p>If you are new to GLFW, you may find the <a href="https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html">tutorial</a> for GLFW 3 useful. If you have used GLFW 2 in the past, there is a <a href="https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/moving.html">transition guide</a> for moving to the GLFW 3 API.</p>
<p>GLFW exists because of the contributions of <a href="CONTRIBUTORS.md">many people</a> around the world, whether by reporting bugs, providing community support, adding features, reviewing or testing code, debugging, proofreading docs, suggesting features or fixing bugs.</p>
<h2 id="compiling-glfw">Compiling GLFW</h2>
<p>GLFW itself requires only the headers and libraries for your OS and window system. It does not need the headers for any context creation API (WGL, GLX, EGL, NSGL, OSMesa) or rendering API (OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Vulkan) to enable support for them.</p>
<p>GLFW supports compilation on Windows with Visual C++ 2010 and later, MinGW and MinGW-w64, on macOS with Clang and on Linux and other Unix-like systems with GCC and Clang. It will likely compile in other environments as well, but this is not regularly tested.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.glfw.org/download.html">pre-compiled Windows binaries</a> available for all supported compilers.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html">compilation guide</a> for more information about how to compile GLFW yourself.</p>
<h2 id="using-glfw">Using GLFW</h2>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/">documentation</a> for tutorials, guides and the API reference.</p>
<h2 id="contributing-to-glfw">Contributing to GLFW</h2>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribution guide</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="system-requirements">System requirements</h2>
<p>GLFW supports Windows XP and later and macOS 10.8 and later. Linux and other Unix-like systems running the X Window System are supported even without a desktop environment or modern extensions, although some features require a running window or clipboard manager. The OSMesa backend requires Mesa 6.3.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compat.html">compatibility guide</a> in the documentation for more information.</p>
<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
<p>GLFW itself depends only on the headers and libraries for your window system.</p>
<p>The (experimental) Wayland backend also depends on the <code>extra-cmake-modules</code> package, which is used to generate Wayland protocol headers.</p>
<p>The examples and test programs depend on a number of tiny libraries. These are located in the <code>deps/</code> directory.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kimgr/getopt_port/">getopt_port</a> for examples with command-line options</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tinycthread/tinycthread">TinyCThread</a> for threaded examples</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad">glad2</a> for loading OpenGL and Vulkan functions</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/datenwolf/linmath.h">linmath.h</a> for linear algebra in examples</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear">Nuklear</a> for test and example UI</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb">stb_image_write</a> for writing images to disk</li>
</ul>
<p>The documentation is generated with <a href="https://doxygen.org/">Doxygen</a> if CMake can find that tool.</p>
