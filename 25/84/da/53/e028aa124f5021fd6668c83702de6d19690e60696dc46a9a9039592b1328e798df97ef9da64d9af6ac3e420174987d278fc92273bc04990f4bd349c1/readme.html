<p><strong>OpenEXR</strong> is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format for use in computer imaging applications. It supports stereoscopic and deep images. OpenEXR's features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher dynamic range and color precision than existing 8- and 10-bit image file formats.</li>
<li>Support for 16-bit floating-point, 32-bit floating-point, and 32-bit integer pixels. The 16-bit floating-point format, called &quot;half&quot;, is compatible with the half data type in NVIDIA's Cg graphics language and is supported natively on their GPUs.</li>
<li>Multiple image compression algorithms, both lossless and lossy. Some of the included codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on images with film grain. The lossy codecs have been tuned for visual quality and decoding performance.</li>
<li>Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily be added by extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR software distribution. New image attributes (strings, vectors, integers, etc.) can be added to OpenEXR image headers without affecting backward compatibility with existing OpenEXR applications.</li>
<li>Support for stereoscopic image workflows and a generalization to multi-views.</li>
<li>Flexible support for deep data: pixels can store a variable-length list of samples and, thus, it is possible to store multiple values at different depths for each pixel. Hard surfaces and volumetric data representations are accommodated.</li>
<li>Multipart: ability to encode separate, but related, images in one file. This allows for access to individual parts without the need to read other parts in the file.</li>
<li>Versioning: OpenEXR source allows for user configurable C++ namespaces to provide protection when using multiple versions of the library in the same process space.</li>
</ul>
<p>OpenEXR is a project of the <a href="https://www.aswf.io">Academy Software Foundation</a>. It was originally developed by Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) in 2003. Weta Digital, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Pixar Animation Studios, DreamWorks, and other studios, companies, and individuals have made contributions to the code base.</p>
<h2 id="openexr-sub-modules">OpenEXR Sub-Modules</h2>
<p>The OpenEXR distribution consists of the following sub-modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IlmBase</strong> - Utility libraries from Industrial Light &amp; Magic: Half, Imath, Iex, IlmThread.</li>
<li><strong>PyIlmBase</strong> - Python bindings for the IlmBase libraries.</li>
<li><strong>OpenEXR</strong> - The core image library.</li>
<li><strong>OpenEXR_Viewers</strong> - Example code for image viewing programs.</li>
<li><strong>Contrib</strong> - Various plugins and utilities, contributed by the community.</li>
</ul>
<p>A collection of OpenEXR images is available from the adjacent repository https://github.com/openexr/openexr-images.</p>

</ul>
<p>The OpenEXR project provides python bindings for the Imath vector/matrix classes, but it does <em>not</em> provide python bindings for reading, writing, or editing .exr files. The <a href="https://github.com/jamesbowman/openexrpython">openexrpython</a> module is not affiliated with the OpenEXR project or the ASWF. Please direct questions there.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/openimageio/home">OpenImageIO</a> also includes python bindings for OpenEXR.</p>
