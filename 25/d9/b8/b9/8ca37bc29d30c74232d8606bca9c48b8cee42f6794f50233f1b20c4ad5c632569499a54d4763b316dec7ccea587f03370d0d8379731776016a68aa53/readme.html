<p>=============================================================================== Prerequisites ===============================================================================</p>
<p>To build FLAC with support for Ogg FLAC you must have built and installed libogg according to the specific instructions below. You must have libogg 1.1.2 or greater, or there will be seeking problems with Ogg FLAC.</p>
<p>If you are building on x86 and want the assembly optimizations, you will need to have NASM &gt;= 0.98.30 installed according to the specific instructions below.</p>
<p>=============================================================================== Note to embedded developers ===============================================================================</p>
<p>libFLAC has grown larger over time as more functionality has been included, but much of it may be unnecessary for a particular embedded implementation. Unused parts may be pruned by some simple editing of configure.ac and src/libFLAC/Makefile.am; the following dependency graph shows which modules may be pruned without breaking things further down:</p>
<p>metadata.h stream_decoder.h format.h</p>
<p>stream_encoder.h stream_decoder.h format.h</p>
<p>stream_decoder.h format.h</p>
<p>In other words, for pure decoding applications, both the stream encoder and metadata editing interfaces can be safely removed.</p>
<p>There is a section dedicated to embedded use in the libFLAC API HTML documentation (see doc/html/api/index.html).</p>
<p>Also, there are several places in the libFLAC code with comments marked with “OPT:” where a #define can be changed to enable code that might be faster on a specific platform. Experimenting with these can yield faster binaries.</p>
<p>=============================================================================== Building in a GNU environment ===============================================================================</p>
<p>FLAC uses autoconf and libtool for configuring and building. Better documentation for these will be forthcoming, but in general, this should work:</p>
<p>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make check &amp;&amp; make install</p>
<p>The ‘make check’ step is optional; omit it to skip all the tests, which can take several hours and use around 70-80 megs of disk space. Even though it will stop with an explicit message on any failure, it does print out a lot of stuff so you might want to capture the output to a file if you’re having a problem. Also, don’t run ‘make check’ as root because it confuses some of the tests.</p>
<p>NOTE: Despite our best efforts it’s entirely possible to have problems when using older versions of autoconf, automake, or libtool. If you have the latest versions and still can’t get it to work, see the next section on Makefile.lite.</p>
<p>There are a few FLAC-specific arguments you can give to `configure’:</p>
<p>–enable-debug : Builds everything with debug symbols and some extra (and more verbose) error checking.</p>
<p>–disable-asm-optimizations : Disables the compilation of the assembly routines. Many routines have assembly versions for speed and `configure’ is pretty good about knowing what is supported, but you can use this option to build only from the C sources. May be necessary for building on OS X (Intel).</p>
<p>–enable-sse : If you are building for an x86 CPU that supports SSE instructions, you can enable some of the faster routines if your operating system also supports SSE instructions. flac can tell if the CPU supports the instructions but currently has no way to test if the OS does, so if it does, you must pass this argument to configure to use the SSE routines. If flac crashes when built with this option you will have to go back and configure without –enable-sse. Note that –disable-asm-optimizations implies –disable-sse.</p>
<p>–enable-local-xmms-plugin : Installs the FLAC XMMS plugin in $HOME/.xmms/Plugins, instead of the global XMMS plugin area (usually /usr/lib/xmms/Input).</p>
<p>–with-ogg= –with-xmms-prefix= –with-libiconv-prefix= Use these if you have these packages but configure can’t find them.</p>
<p>If you want to build completely from scratch (i.e. starting with just configure.ac and Makefile.am) you should be able to just run ‘autogen.sh’ but make sure and read the comments in that file first.</p>
<p>=============================================================================== Building with Makefile.lite ===============================================================================</p>
<p>There is a more lightweight build system for do-it-yourself-ers. It is also useful if configure isn’t working, which may be the case since lately we’ve had some problems with different versions of automake and libtool. The Makefile.lite system should work on GNU systems with few or no adjustments.</p>
<p>From the top level just ‘make -f Makefile.lite’. You can specify zero or one optional target from ‘release’, ‘debug’, ‘test’, or ‘clean’. The default is ‘release’. There is no ‘install’ target but everything you need will end up in the obj/ directory.</p>
<p>If you are not on an x86 system or you don’t have nasm, you may have to change the DEFINES in src/libFLAC/Makefile.lite. If you don’t have nasm, remove -DFLAC__HAS_NASM. If your target is not an x86, change -DFLAC__CPU_IA32 to -DFLAC__CPU_UNKNOWN.</p>
<p>=============================================================================== Building with MSVC ===============================================================================</p>
<p>When building with MSVC, using CMake is preferred, see Building with CMake for more information. Building with MSVC using solution files is deprecated and these files will be removed in the future.</p>
<p>There are .vcproj projects and a master FLAC.sln solution to build all the libraries and executables with MSVC 2005 or newer.</p>
<p>Prerequisite: you must have the Ogg libraries installed as described later.</p>
<p>Prerequisite: you must have nasm installed, and nasm.exe must be in your PATH, or the path to nasm.exe must be added to the list of directories for executable files in the MSVC global options.</p>
<p>To build everything, run Visual Studio, do File|Open and open FLAC.sln. From the dropdown in the toolbar, select “Release” instead of “Debug”, then do Build|Build Solution.</p>
<p>This will build all libraries both statically (e.g. objs_static.lib) and as DLLs (e.g. objs.dll), and it will build all binaries, statically linked (e.g. objs.exe).</p>
<p>Everything will end up in the “objs” directory. DLLs and .exe files are all that are needed and can be copied to an installation area and added to the PATH.</p>
<p>By default the code is configured with Ogg support. Before building FLAC you will need to get the Ogg source distribution (see http://xiph.org/downloads/), build libogg_static.lib (load win32_static.sln, change solution configuration to “Release” and code generation to “Multi-threaded (/MT)”, then build), copy libogg_static.lib into FLAC’s ‘objs’ directory, and copy the entire includetree into FLAC’s ‘include’ directory (so that there is an ‘ogg’ directory in FLAC’s ‘include’ directory with the files ogg.h, os_types.h and config_types.h).</p>
<p>If you want to build without Ogg support, instead edit all .vcproj files and remove any “FLAC__HAS_OGG” definitions.</p>
<p>=============================================================================== Building on Mac OS X ===============================================================================</p>
<p>If you have Fink or a recent version of OS X with the proper autotools, the GNU flow above should work.</p>
<p>=============================================================================== Building with CMake ===============================================================================</p>
<p>CMake is a cross-platform build system. FLAC can be built on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X using CMake.</p>
<p>You can use either CMake’s CLI or GUI. We recommend you to have a separate build folder outside the repository in order to not spoil it with generated files.</p>
<h2 id="cli">CLI</h2>
<p>Go to your build folder and run something like this:</p>
<p>/path/to/flac/build$ cmake /path/to/flac/source</p>
<p>or e.g. in Windows shell</p>
<p>C:&gt; cmake  (provided that cmake is in your %PATH% variable)</p>
<p>That will generate build scripts for the default build system (e.g. Makefiles for UNIX). After that you start build with a command like this:</p>
<p>/path/to/flac/build$ make</p>
<p>And afterwards you can run tests or install the built libraries and headers</p>
<p>/path/to/flac/build$ make test /path/to/flac/build$ make install</p>
<p>If you want use a build system other than default add -G flag to cmake, e.g.:</p>
<p>/path/to/flac/build$ cmake /path/to/flac/source -GNinja /path/to/flac/build$ ninja</p>
<p>or:</p>
<p>/path/to/flac/build$ cmake /path/to/flac/source -GXcode</p>
<p>Use cmake –help to see the list of available generators.</p>
<p>If you have OGG on your system you can tell CMake to use it:</p>
<p>/path/to/flac/build$ cmake /path/to/flac/source -DWITH_OGG=ON</p>
<p>If CMake fails to find it you can help CMake by specifying the exact path:</p>
<p>/path/to/flac/build$ cmake /path/to/flac/source -DWITH_OGG=ON -DOGG_ROOT=/path/to/ogg</p>
<p>CMake will search for OGG by default so if you don’t have it you can tell cmake to not do so:</p>
<p>/path/to/flac/build$ cmake /path/to/flac/source -DWITH_OGG=OFF</p>
<p>Other FLAC’s options (e.g. building C++ lib or docs) can also be put to cmake through -D flag.</p>
<h2 id="gui">GUI</h2>
<p>It is likely that you would prefer to use it on Windows building for Visual Studio. It’s in essence the same process as building using CLI.</p>
<p>Open cmake-gui. In the window select a source directory (the repository’s root), a build directory (some other directory outside the repository). Then press button “Configure”. CMake will ask you which build system you prefer. Choose that version of Visual Studio which you have on your system, choose whether you want to build for x86 or amd64. Press OK. After CMake finishes press “Generate” button, and after that “Open Project”. In response CMake will launch Visual Studio and open the generated solution. You can use it as usual but remember that it was generated by CMake. That means that your changes (e.g. some addidional compile flags) will be lost when you run CMake next time.</p>
<p>Again, if you have OGG on your system set WITH_OGG flag in the list of variables in cmake-gui window before you press “Configure”.</p>
<p>If CMake fails to find MSVC compiler then running cmake-gui from MS Developer comand prompt should help.</p>
