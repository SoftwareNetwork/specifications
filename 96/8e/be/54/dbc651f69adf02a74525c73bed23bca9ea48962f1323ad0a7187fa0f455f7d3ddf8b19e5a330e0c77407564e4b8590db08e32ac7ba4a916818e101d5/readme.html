<h2 id="repository-for-opencvs-extra-modules">Repository for OpenCV’s
extra modules</h2>
<p>This repository is intended for the development of so-called “extra”
modules, contributed functionality. New modules quite often do not have
stable API, and they are not well-tested. Thus, they shouldn’t be
released as a part of the official OpenCV distribution, since the
library maintains binary compatibility, and tries to provide decent
performance and stability.</p>
<p>So, all the new modules should be developed separately, and published
in the <code>opencv_contrib</code> repository at first. Later, when the
module matures and gains popularity, it is moved to the central OpenCV
repository, and the development team provides production-quality support
for this module.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-build-opencv-with-extra-modules">How to build OpenCV with
extra modules</h3>
<p>You can build OpenCV, so it will include the modules from this
repository. Contrib modules are under constant development and it is
recommended to use them alongside the master branch or latest releases
of OpenCV.</p>
<p>Here is the CMake command for you:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd &lt;opencv_build_directory&gt;
$ cmake -DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=&lt;opencv_contrib&gt;/modules &lt;opencv_source_directory&gt;
$ make -j5</code></pre>
<p>As the result, OpenCV will be built in the
<code>&lt;opencv_build_directory&gt;</code> with all modules from
<code>opencv_contrib</code> repository. If you don’t want all of the
modules, use CMake’s <code>BUILD_opencv_*</code> options. Like in this
example:</p>
<pre><code>$ cmake -DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=&lt;opencv_contrib&gt;/modules -DBUILD_opencv_legacy=OFF &lt;opencv_source_directory&gt;</code></pre>
<p>If you also want to build the samples from the “samples” folder of
each module, also include the “-DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON” option.</p>
<p>If you prefer using the GUI version of CMake (cmake-gui), then, you
can add <code>opencv_contrib</code> modules within <code>opencv</code>
core by doing the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Start cmake-gui.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the opencv source code folder and the folder where
binaries will be built (the 2 upper forms of the interface).</p></li>
<li><p>Press the <code>configure</code> button. You will see all the
opencv build parameters in the central interface.</p></li>
<li><p>Browse the parameters and look for the form called
<code>OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH</code> (use the search form to focus
rapidly on it).</p></li>
<li><p>Complete this <code>OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH</code> by the
proper pathname to the <code>&lt;opencv_contrib&gt;/modules</code> value
using its browse button.</p></li>
<li><p>Press the <code>configure</code> button followed by the
<code>generate</code> button (the first time, you will be asked which
makefile style to use).</p></li>
<li><p>Build the <code>opencv</code> core with the method you chose
(make and make install if you chose Unix makefile at step 6).</p></li>
<li><p>To run, linker flags to contrib modules will need to be added to
use them in your code/IDE. For example to use the aruco module,
“-lopencv_aruco” flag will be added.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="update-the-repository-documentation">Update the repository
documentation</h3>
<p>In order to keep a clean overview containing all contributed modules,
the following files need to be created/adapted:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Update the README.md file under the modules folder. Here, you add
your model with a single-line description.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a README.md inside your own module folder. This README
explains which functionality (separate functions) is available, links to
the corresponding samples, and explains in somewhat more detail what the
module is expected to do. If any extra requirements are needed to build
the module without problems, add them here also.</p></li>
</ol>
