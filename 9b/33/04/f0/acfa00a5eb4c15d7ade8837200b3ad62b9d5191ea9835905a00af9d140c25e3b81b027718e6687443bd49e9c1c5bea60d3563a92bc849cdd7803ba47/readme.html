<p>This package contains the GNU Bison parser generator.</p>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<h2 id="build-from-git">Build from git</h2>
<p>Here are basic installation instructions for a repository checkout:</p>
<pre><code>$ git submodule update --init
$ ./bootstrap</code></pre>
<p>then proceed with the usual <code>configure &amp;&amp; make</code> steps.</p>
<p>The file README-hacking.md is about building, modifying and checking Bison.</p>
<h2 id="build-from-tarball">Build from tarball</h2>
<p>See the file INSTALL for generic compilation and installation instructions.</p>
<p>Bison requires GNU m4 1.4.6 or later. See https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/m4/m4-1.4.6.tar.gz.</p>
<h2 id="colored-diagnostics">Colored diagnostics</h2>
<p>As an experimental feature, diagnostics are now colored, controlled by the <code>--color</code> and <code>--style</code> options.</p>
<p>To use them, install the libtextstyle library before configuring Bison. It is available from https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/gettext/, for instance https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/gettext/libtextstyle-0.8.tar.gz.</p>
<p>The option --color supports the following arguments: - always, yes: Enable colors. - never, no: Disable colors. - auto, tty (default): Enable colors if the output device is a tty.</p>
<p>To customize the styles, create a CSS file, say <code>bison-bw.css</code>, similar to</p>
<pre><code>/* bison-bw.css */
.warning   { }
.error     { font-weight: 800; text-decoration: underline; }
.note      { }</code></pre>
<p>then invoke bison with <code>--style=bison-bw.css</code>, or set the <code>BISON_STYLE</code> environment variable to <code>bison-bw.css</code>.</p>
<h2 id="relocatability">Relocatability</h2>
<p>If you pass <code>--enable-relocatable</code> to <code>configure</code>, Bison is relocatable.</p>
<p>A relocatable program can be moved or copied to a different location on the file system. It can also be used through mount points for network sharing. It is possible to make symlinks to the installed and moved programs, and invoke them through the symlink.</p>
<p>See &quot;Enabling Relocatability&quot; in the documentation.</p>
<h2 id="internationalization">Internationalization</h2>
<p>Bison supports two catalogs: one for Bison itself (i.e., for the maintainer-side parser generation), and one for the generated parsers (i.e., for the user-side parser execution). The requirements between both differ: bison needs ngettext, the generated parsers do not. To simplify the build system, neither are installed if ngettext is not supported, even if generated parsers could have been localized. See http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bison/2009-08/msg00006.html for more details.</p>
<h1 id="questions">Questions</h1>
<p>See the section FAQ in the documentation (doc/bison.info) for frequently asked questions. The documentation is also available in PDF and HTML, provided you have a recent version of Texinfo installed: run <code>make pdf</code> or <code>make html</code>.</p>
<p>If you have questions about using Bison and the documentation does not answer them, please send mail to <a href="mailto:help-bison@gnu.org">help-bison@gnu.org</a>.</p>
<h1 id="bug-reports">Bug reports</h1>
<p>Please send bug reports to <a href="mailto:bug-bison@gnu.org">bug-bison@gnu.org</a>. Be sure to include the version number from <code>bison --version</code>, and a complete, self-contained test case in each bug report.</p>
