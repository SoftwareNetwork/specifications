<p><strong>pybind11</strong> is a lightweight header-only library that
exposes C++ types in Python and vice versa, mainly to create Python
bindings of existing C++ code. Its goals and syntax are similar to the
excellent <a
href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/python/doc/">Boost.Python</a>
library by David Abrahams: to minimize boilerplate code in traditional
extension modules by inferring type information using compile-time
introspection.</p>
<p>The main issue with Boost.Python—and the reason for creating such a
similar project—is Boost. Boost is an enormously large and complex suite
of utility libraries that works with almost every C++ compiler in
existence. This compatibility has its cost: arcane template tricks and
workarounds are necessary to support the oldest and buggiest of compiler
specimens. Now that C++11-compatible compilers are widely available,
this heavy machinery has become an excessively large and unnecessary
dependency.</p>
<p>Think of this library as a tiny self-contained version of
Boost.Python with everything stripped away that isn't relevant for
binding generation. Without comments, the core header files only require
~4K lines of code and depend on Python (3.6+, or PyPy) and the C++
standard library. This compact implementation was possible thanks to
some of the new C++11 language features (specifically: tuples, lambda
functions and variadic templates). Since its creation, this library has
grown beyond Boost.Python in many ways, leading to dramatically simpler
binding code in many common situations.</p>

<h1 id="core-features">Core features</h1>
<p>pybind11 can map the following core C++ features to Python:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions accepting and returning custom data structures per value,
reference, or pointer</li>
<li>Instance methods and static methods</li>
<li>Overloaded functions</li>
<li>Instance attributes and static attributes</li>
<li>Arbitrary exception types</li>
<li>Enumerations</li>
<li>Callbacks</li>
<li>Iterators and ranges</li>
<li>Custom operators</li>
<li>Single and multiple inheritance</li>
<li>STL data structures</li>
<li>Smart pointers with reference counting like
<code>std::shared_ptr</code></li>
<li>Internal references with correct reference counting</li>
<li>C++ classes with virtual (and pure virtual) methods can be extended
in Python</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="goodies">Goodies</h1>
<p>In addition to the core functionality, pybind11 provides some extra
goodies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python 3.6+, and PyPy3 7.3 are supported with an
implementation-agnostic interface (pybind11 2.9 was the last version to
support Python 2 and 3.5).</li>
<li>It is possible to bind C++11 lambda functions with captured
variables. The lambda capture data is stored inside the resulting Python
function object.</li>
<li>pybind11 uses C++11 move constructors and move assignment operators
whenever possible to efficiently transfer custom data types.</li>
<li>It's easy to expose the internal storage of custom data types
through Pythons' buffer protocols. This is handy e.g. for fast
conversion between C++ matrix classes like Eigen and NumPy without
expensive copy operations.</li>
<li>pybind11 can automatically vectorize functions so that they are
transparently applied to all entries of one or more NumPy array
arguments.</li>
<li>Python's slice-based access and assignment operations can be
supported with just a few lines of code.</li>
<li>Everything is contained in just a few header files; there is no need
to link against any additional libraries.</li>
<li>Binaries are generally smaller by a factor of at least 2 compared to
equivalent bindings generated by Boost.Python. A recent pybind11
conversion of PyRosetta, an enormous Boost.Python binding project, <a
href="https://graylab.jhu.edu/Sergey/2016.RosettaCon/PyRosetta-4.pdf">reported</a>
a binary size reduction of <strong>5.4x</strong> and compile time
reduction by <strong>5.8x</strong>.</li>
<li>Function signatures are precomputed at compile time (using
<code>constexpr</code>), leading to smaller binaries.</li>
<li>With little extra effort, C++ types can be pickled and unpickled
similar to regular Python objects.</li>
</ul>
