<h1 id="libsigc-the-typesafe-callback-framework-for-c">libsigc++ : The Typesafe Callback Framework for C++</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>libsigc++ implements a typesafe callback system for standard C++. It allows you to define signals and to connect those signals to any callback function, either global or a member function, regardless of whether it is static or virtual.</p>
<p>libsigc++ is used by gtkmm to wrap the GTK+ signal system. It does not depend on GTK+ or gtkmm.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://libsigcplusplus.github.io/libsigcplusplus/">libsigc++ web site</a></p>
<h2 id="license">License</h2>
<p>Distribution of library and components is under the LGPL as listed in the file COPYING. Examples and tests are Public Domain.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>Compatible compilers must support C++17, such as the decltype(auto) specifier (from C++14) and std::invoke().</p>
<h2 id="build">Build</h2>
<p>Whenever possible, you should use the official binary packages approved by the supplier of your operating system, such as your Linux distribution. For instance, Ubuntu Linux, Debian Linux and Fedora Linux have official libsigc++ packages.</p>
<h2 id="building-from-a-release-tarball">Building from a release tarball</h2>
<p>Building from the <a href="https://github.com/libsigcplusplus/libsigcplusplus/releases">libsigc++ release tarball</a> is easier than building from git.</p>
<p>It's easiest to build with Meson, if the tarball was made with Meson, and to build with Autotools, if the tarball was made with Autotools. Then you don't have to use maintainer-mode.</p>
<p>How do you know how the tarball was made? If it was made with Meson, it contains files in untracked/build_scripts/, untracked/docs/ and possibly other subdirectories of untracked/.</p>
<h3 id="building-from-a-tarball-with-meson">Building from a tarball with Meson</h3>
<p>Don't call the builddir 'build'. There is a directory called 'build' with files used by Autotools.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co"># If the tarball was made with Autotools, and you want to rebuild the reference</span>
<span class="co"># documentation, you must enable maintainer-mode:</span>
$ <span class="ex">meson</span> --prefix=/usr/local --libdir=lib -Dmaintainer-mode=true your_builddir .

<span class="co"># If the tarball was made with Meson, or you don&#39;t want to rebuild the docs:</span>
$ <span class="ex">meson</span> --prefix=/usr/local --libdir=lib your_builddir .

<span class="co"># then:</span>
$ <span class="bu">cd</span> your_builddir
$ <span class="ex">ninja</span>
$ <span class="ex">ninja</span> install
<span class="co"># You can run the tests like so:</span>
$ <span class="ex">ninja</span> test</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="building-from-a-tarball-with-autotools">Building from a tarball with Autotools</h3>
<p>For instance:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co"># If the tarball was made with Autotools:</span>
$ <span class="ex">./configure</span> --prefix=/usr/local

<span class="co"># If the tarball was made with Meson, you must enable maintainer-mode:</span>
$ <span class="ex">./autogen.sh</span> --prefix=/usr/local

<span class="co"># then:</span>
$ <span class="fu">make</span>
$ <span class="fu">make</span> install
<span class="co"># You can build the examples and tests, and run the tests, like so:</span>
$ <span class="fu">make</span> check</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="building-from-git">Building from git</h2>
<p>Building from git can be difficult so you should prefer building from a release tarball unless you need to work on the libsigc++ code itself.</p>
<p>jhbuild can be a good help. See the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/jhbuild">jhbuild repo</a> and the <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Jhbuild">jhbuild wiki</a>.</p>
<h3 id="building-from-git-with-meson">Building from git with Meson</h3>
<p>You must have Meson properly installed (meson, ninja, etc) and you will also need <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mm-common/">mm-common</a> version 1.0.0 or higher.</p>
<p>Maintainer-mode is enabled by default when you build from a git clone.</p>
<p>Don't call the builddir 'build'. There is a directory called 'build' with files used by Autotools.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="ex">meson</span> --prefix=/usr/local --libdir=lib your_builddir .
$ <span class="bu">cd</span> your_builddir
$ <span class="ex">ninja</span>
$ <span class="ex">ninja</span> install
<span class="co"># You can run the tests like so:</span>
$ <span class="ex">ninja</span> test
<span class="co"># You can create a tarball like so:</span>
$ <span class="ex">ninja</span> dist</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="building-from-git-with-autotools">Building from git with Autotools</h3>
<p>You must have Autotools properly installed (autoconf, automake, etc) and you will also need <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mm-common/">mm-common</a>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="ex">./autogen.sh</span> --prefix=/usr/local
$ <span class="fu">make</span>
$ <span class="fu">make</span> install
<span class="co"># You can build the examples and tests, and run the tests, like so:</span>
$ <span class="fu">make</span> check
<span class="co"># You can create a tarball like so:</span>
$ <span class="fu">make</span> distcheck
<span class="co"># or</span>
$ <span class="fu">make</span> dist</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="building-from-git-with-cmake">Building from git with CMake</h3>
<p>The CMake build is not used very often by the libsigc++ developers, but it should work, and we would welcome improvements.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="fu">mkdir</span> libsigcplusplus_build
$ <span class="bu">cd</span> libsigcplusplus_build
$ <span class="fu">cmake</span> path/to/libsigcplusplus
$ <span class="fu">make</span></code></pre></div>
