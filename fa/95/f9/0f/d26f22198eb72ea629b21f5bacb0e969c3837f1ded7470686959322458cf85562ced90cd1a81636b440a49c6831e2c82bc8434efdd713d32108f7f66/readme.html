<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>GLFW is an Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES
and Vulkan application development. It provides a simple,
platform-independent API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces,
reading input, handling events, etc.</p>
<p>GLFW natively supports Windows, macOS and Linux and other Unix-like
systems. On Linux both X11 and Wayland are supported.</p>
<p>GLFW is licensed under the <a
href="https://www.glfw.org/license.html">zlib/libpng license</a>.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.glfw.org/download.html">download</a> the
latest stable release as source or Windows binaries, or fetch the
<code>latest</code> branch from GitHub. Each release starting with 3.0
also has a corresponding <a
href="https://github.com/glfw/glfw/releases">annotated tag</a> with
source and binary archives.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/">documentation</a> is
available online and is included in all source and binary archives. See
the <a href="https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/news.html">release
notes</a> for new features, caveats and deprecations in the latest
release. For more details see the <a
href="https://www.glfw.org/changelog.html">version history</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>master</code> branch is the stable integration branch and
<em>should</em> always compile and run on all supported platforms,
although details of newly added features may change until they have been
included in a release. New features and many bug fixes live in <a
href="https://github.com/glfw/glfw/branches/all">other branches</a>
until they are stable enough to merge.</p>
<p>If you are new to GLFW, you may find the <a
href="https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html">tutorial</a> for GLFW
3 useful. If you have used GLFW 2 in the past, there is a <a
href="https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/moving.html">transition guide</a>
for moving to the GLFW 3 API.</p>
<p>GLFW exists because of the contributions of <a
href="CONTRIBUTORS.md">many people</a> around the world, whether by
reporting bugs, providing community support, adding features, reviewing
or testing code, debugging, proofreading docs, suggesting features or
fixing bugs.</p>
<h2 id="compiling-glfw">Compiling GLFW</h2>
<p>GLFW itself requires only the headers and libraries for your OS and
window system. It does not need the headers for any context creation API
(WGL, GLX, EGL, NSGL, OSMesa) or rendering API (OpenGL, OpenGL ES,
Vulkan) to enable support for them.</p>
<p>GLFW supports compilation on Windows with Visual C++ 2010 and later,
MinGW and MinGW-w64, on macOS with Clang and on Linux and other
Unix-like systems with GCC and Clang. It will likely compile in other
environments as well, but this is not regularly tested.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.glfw.org/download.html">pre-compiled
Windows binaries</a> available for all supported compilers.</p>
<p>See the <a
href="https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html">compilation
guide</a> for more information about how to compile GLFW yourself.</p>
<h2 id="using-glfw">Using GLFW</h2>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/">documentation</a>
for tutorials, guides and the API reference.</p>
<h2 id="contributing-to-glfw">Contributing to GLFW</h2>
<p>See the <a
href="https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribution
guide</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="system-requirements">System requirements</h2>
<p>GLFW supports Windows XP and later and macOS 10.8 and later. Linux
and other Unix-like systems running the X Window System are supported
even without a desktop environment or modern extensions, although some
features require a running window or clipboard manager. The OSMesa
backend requires Mesa 6.3.</p>
<p>See the <a
href="https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compat.html">compatibility
guide</a> in the documentation for more information.</p>
<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
<p>GLFW itself depends only on the headers and libraries for your window
system.</p>
<p>The (experimental) Wayland backend also depends on the
<code>extra-cmake-modules</code> package, which is used to generate
Wayland protocol headers.</p>
<p>The examples and test programs depend on a number of tiny libraries.
These are located in the <code>deps/</code> directory.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kimgr/getopt_port/">getopt_port</a> for
examples with command-line options</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tinycthread/tinycthread">TinyCThread</a>
for threaded examples</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad">glad2</a> for loading
OpenGL and Vulkan functions</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/datenwolf/linmath.h">linmath.h</a> for
linear algebra in examples</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear">Nuklear</a>
for test and example UI</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb">stb_image_write</a> for
writing images to disk</li>
</ul>
<p>The documentation is generated with <a
href="https://doxygen.org/">Doxygen</a> if CMake can find that tool.</p>
