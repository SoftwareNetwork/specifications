<h1 id="boost.compat">Boost.Compat</h1>
<p>Boost.Compat is a repository of C++11 implementations of standard
components added in later C++ standards. Its target audience is Boost
library authors whose libraries support a lower C++ standard, but wish
to utilize a component added in a subsequent one.</p>
<p>The criteria for inclusion in Boost.Compat are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The implementation should be relatively simple and header-only.</li>
<li>The component must implement the standard functionality exactly,
without deviations or extensions. This allows (but does not require) the
implementation to be a simple <code>using</code> declaration in case the
standard component is available.</li>
<li>The component must not depend on any Boost libraries except
Boost.Config, Boost.Assert, or Boost.ThrowException.</li>
<li>The component must not be a vocabulary type, visible in the library
APIs. The user should never see a <code>boost::compat</code> type; the
use of Compat types should be confined to library implementations.</li>
</ul>
