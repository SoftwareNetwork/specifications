<p>cmix version 17 http://www.byronknoll.com/cmix.html Released by Byron Knoll on March 24, 2019.</p>
<p>cmix is a lossless data compression program aimed at optimizing compression ratio at the cost of high CPU/memory usage. cmix is free software distributed under the GNU General Public License.</p>
<p>cmix works in Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. At least 32GB of RAM is recommended to run cmix. Feel free to contact me at byron@byronknoll.com if you have any questions.</p>
<p>In Linux or OS X, use &quot;make&quot; to compile cmix using g++. In Windows, cmix can be compiled with MinGW (http://nuwen.net/mingw.html) or Cygwin (https://www.cygwin.com).</p>
<p>When running cmix, it is usually recommended to enable preprocessing with &quot;dictionary/english.dic&quot;.</p>
<p>cmix can only compress/decompress single files. To compress multiple files or directories, create an archive file using &quot;tar&quot; (or some similar tool).</p>
<p>For some files, preprocessing using &quot;precomp&quot; may improve compression: https://github.com/schnaader/precomp-cpp</p>
<p>Compiling with &quot;-Ofast&quot; will have the fastest performance, but might lead to incompatibility between different computers (due to floating-point precision differences). Compile with &quot;-O3&quot; to fix compatibility issues.</p>
