<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>CinoLib is header only. It does not need to be installed, all you have to do is to clone the repo with</p>
<pre><code>git clone --recursive https://github.com/mlivesu/cinolib.git</code></pre>
<p>and include in your C++ application the header files you need. A tutorial with detailed info on how to use the library is under developement. In the meanwhile, you can explore the <a href="https://github.com/mlivesu/cinolib/tree/master/examples#examples"><strong>examples</strong></a> folder, which contains a constantly growing number of sample projects that showcase the core features of the library, and will be the backbone of the forthcoming tutorial.</p>
