<p>There are two main branches with an infinite lifetime: * <strong>master</strong> is the main branch and it is marked as every version release. * <strong>develop</strong> is also another main branch where the source code reflects a state with the lastest delivered developement changes for the next release.</p>
<p>Other branches: * <strong>features</strong> are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release. Feature branches are named as 'feature-FEATURENAME'. * <strong>hotfix</strong> is meant to prepare for a new release, and fixes some bugs from the corresponding tag on the master branch.</p>
