<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>re2c is a free and open-source lexer generator for C, C++ and Go.</p>
<p>Its main goal is generating fast lexers: at least as fast as their reasonably optimized hand-coded counterparts. Instead of using traditional table-driven approach, re2c encodes the generated finite state automata directly in the form of conditional jumps and comparisons. The resulting programs are faster and often smaller than their table-driven analogues, and they are much easier to debug and understand. re2c applies quite a few optimizations in order to speed up and compress the generated code.</p>
<p>Another distinctive feature is its flexible interface: instead of assuming a fixed program template, re2c lets the programmer write most of the interface code and adapt the generated lexer to any particular environment.</p>
