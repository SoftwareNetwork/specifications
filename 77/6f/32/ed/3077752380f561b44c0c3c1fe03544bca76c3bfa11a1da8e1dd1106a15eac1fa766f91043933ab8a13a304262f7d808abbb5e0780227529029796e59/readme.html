<p>mp++ is a C++11 library for multiprecision arithmetic, currently supporting arbitrary-precision integers, rationals and floats, and quadruple-precision floats.</p>
<p>Based on well-known libraries such as <a href="https://gmplib.org/">GMP</a>, <a href="https://www.mpfr.org">MPFR</a>, and others, mp++ was initially conceived as a <a href="https://gmplib.org/">GMP</a> wrapper with a special focus on performance with small operands. In particular, a small buffer optimisation and custom implementations of basic mathematical primitives are instrumental in achieving a performance increase, with respect to GMP and other integer multiprecision libraries, which can be substantial (see the <a href="https://bluescarni.github.io/mppp/benchmarks.html">benchmarks</a> section of the documentation). The price to pay is a small overhead when operating on large integers.</p>
<p>Eventually, a multiprecision rational class and two multiprecision floating-point classes were added, and today a secondary objective of mp++ is to provide a modern, consistent and unified C++ interface to several lower-level multiprecision libraries.</p>
<p>mp++ is a spinoff of the <a href="https://github.com/bluescarni/piranha">Piranha</a> library, released under the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/FAQ/">MPL2</a> license.</p>
