<h1 id="hpx">HPX</h1>
<p>HPX is a C++ Standard Library for Concurrency and Parallelism. It implements all of the corresponding facilities as defined by the C++ Standard. Additionally, in HPX we implement functionalities proposed as part of the ongoing C++ standardization process. We also extend the C++ Standard APIs to the distributed case.</p>
<p>The goal of HPX is to create a high quality, freely available, open source implementation of a new programming model for conventional systems, such as classic Linux based Beowulf clusters or multi-socket highly parallel SMP nodes. At the same time, we want to have a very modular and well designed runtime system architecture which would allow us to port our implementation onto new computer system architectures. We want to use real-world applications to drive the development of the runtime system, coining out required functionalities and converging onto a stable API which will provide a smooth migration path for developers.</p>
<p>The API exposed by HPX is not only modeled after the interfaces defined by the C++11/14/17/20 ISO standard, it also adheres to the programming guidelines used by the Boost collection of C++ libraries. We aim to improve the scalability of today's applications and to expose new levels of parallelism which are necessary to take advantage of the exascale systems of the future.</p>
<h2 id="whats-so-special-about-hpx">What's so special about HPX?</h2>
<ul>
<li>HPX exposes a uniform, standards-oriented API for ease of programming parallel and distributed applications.</li>
<li>It enables programmers to write fully asynchronous code using hundreds of millions of threads.</li>
<li>HPX provides unified syntax and semantics for local and remote operations.</li>
<li>HPX makes concurrency manageable with dataflow and future based synchronization.</li>
<li>It implements a rich set of runtime services supporting a broad range of use cases.</li>
<li>HPX exposes a uniform, flexible, and extendable performance counter framework which can enable runtime adaptivity</li>
<li>It is designed to solve problems conventionally considered to be scaling-impaired.</li>
<li>HPX has been designed and developed for systems of any scale, from hand-held devices to very large scale systems.</li>
<li>It is the first fully functional implementation of the ParalleX execution model.</li>
<li>HPX is published under a liberal open-source license and has an open, active, and thriving developer community.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="governance">Governance</h2>
<p>The HPX project is a meritocratic, consensus-based community project. Anyone with an interest in the project can join the community, contribute to the project design and participate in the decision making process. <a href="http://hpx.stellar-group.org/documents/governance/">This document</a> describes how that participation takes place and how to set about earning merit within the project community.</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>If you plan to use HPX we suggest to start with the latest released version which can be downloaded <a href="https://stellar.cct.lsu.edu/downloads/">here</a>.</p>
<p>To quickly get started with HPX on most Linux distributions you can read the quick start guide <a href="https://hpx-docs.stellar-group.org/latest/html/quickstart.html">here</a>. Detailed instructions on building and installing HPX on various platforms can be found <a href="https://hpx-docs.stellar-group.org/latest/html/manual/building_hpx.html">here</a>. The full documentation for the latest release of HPX can always be found <a href="https://hpx-docs.stellar-group.org/latest/html/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to work with the cutting edge version of this repository (<code>master</code> branch) the documentation can be found <a href="https://hpx-docs.stellar-group.org/branches/master/html/index.html">here</a>. We strongly recommend that you follow the current health status of the master branch by looking at our <a href="https://cdash.cscs.ch//index.php?project=HPX">continuous integration results website</a>. While we try to keep the master branch stable and usable, sometimes new bugs trick their way into the code base. The <a href="https://circleci.com/gh/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx">CircleCI</a> continuous integration service additionally tracks the current build status for the master branch: <a href="https://circleci.com/gh/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/tree/master"><img src="https://circleci.com/gh/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/tree/master.svg?style=svg" alt="HPX master branch build status" /></a>.</p>
