<p>You can get the latest source code by Subversion at InriaForge:</p>
<p>svn checkout svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/mpfr/trunk mpfr</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>svn checkout https://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/mpfr/trunk mpfr</p>
<p>(the last argument can be any directory name). You can use</p>
<p>svn ls svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/mpfr/branches svn ls svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/mpfr/tags</p>
<p>to get the list of branches or tags (releases), then checkout a particular branch or tag instead of the trunk. Alternatively, you can now use the &quot;https:&quot; scheme (a.k.a. DAV) instead of &quot;svn:&quot;. For more information about Subversion, please see:</p>

<li>https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SvnHelp (written for GCC developers, but interesting general information can be found there);</li>
<li>http://subversion.apache.org/faq.html (the Subversion FAQ).</li>
</ul>
<p>Subversion users should read the file &quot;doc/README.dev&quot; (in the source tree).</p>
