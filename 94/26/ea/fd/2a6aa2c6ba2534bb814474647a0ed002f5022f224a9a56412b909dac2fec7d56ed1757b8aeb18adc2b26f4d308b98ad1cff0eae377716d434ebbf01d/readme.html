<p>libcuckoo provides a high-performance, compact hash table that allows multiple concurrent reader and writer threads.</p>
<p>The Doxygen-generated documentation is available at the <a href="http://efficient.github.io/libcuckoo/">project page</a>.</p>

<p>For details about this algorithm and citations, please refer to our papers in <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/memc3-nsdi2013.pdf" title="MemC3: Compact and Concurrent Memcache with Dumber Caching and Smarter Hashing">NSDI 2013</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mfreed/docs/cuckoo-eurosys14.pdf" title="Algorithmic Improvements for Fast Concurrent Cuckoo Hashing">EuroSys 2014</a>. Some of the details of the hashing algorithm have been improved since that work (e.g., the previous algorithm in <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/memc3-nsdi2013.pdf" title="MemC3: Compact and Concurrent Memcache with Dumber Caching and Smarter Hashing">1</a> serializes all writer threads, while our current implementation supports multiple concurrent writers), however, and this source code is now the definitive reference.</p>
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<p>This library has been tested on Mac OSX &gt;= 10.8 and Ubuntu &gt;= 12.04.</p>
<p>It compiles with clang++ &gt;= 3.3 and g++ &gt;= 4.8, however we strongly suggest using the latest versions of both compilers, as they have greatly improved support for atomic operations. Building the library requires CMake version &gt;= 3.1.0. To install it on Ubuntu</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install cmake</code></pre>
<h1 id="building">Building</h1>
<p>libcuckoo is a header-only library, so in order to get going, just add the <code>libcuckoo</code> subdirectory to your include path. These directions cover installing the library to a particular location on your system, and also building any the examples and tests included in the repository.</p>
<p>We suggest you build out of source, in a separate <code>build</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir build
$ cd build</code></pre>
<p>There are numerous flags you can pass to <code>CMake</code> to set which parts of the repository it builds.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code></dt>
<dd>set the location where the libcuckoo header files are installed
</dd>
<dt><code>-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</code></dt>
<dd>enable different types of build flags for different purposes
</dd>
<dt><code>-DBUILD_EXAMPLES=1</code></dt>
<dd>tell <code>CMake</code> to build the <code>examples</code> directory
</dd>
<dt><code>-DBUILD_TESTS=1</code></dt>
<dd>build all tests in the <code>tests</code> directory
</dd>
<dt><code>-DBUILD_STRESS_TESTS=1</code></dt>
<dd>build all tests in the <code>tests/stress-tests</code> directory
</dd>
<dt><code>-DBUILD_UNIT_TESTS=1</code></dt>
<dd>build all tests in the <code>tests/unit-tests</code> directory
</dd>
<dt><code>-DBUILD_UNIVERSAL_BENCHMARK=1</code></dt>
<dd>build the universal benchmark in the <code>tests/universal-benchmark</code> directory. This benchmark allows you to test a variety of operations in arbitrary percentages, with specific keys and values. Consult the <code>README</code> in the benchmark directory for more details.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, if, for example, we want to build all examples and all tests into a local installation directory, we'd run the following command from the <code>build</code> directory.</p>
<pre><code>$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=1 -DBUILD_TESTS=1 ..
$ make all
$ make install</code></pre>
<h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>
<p>When compiling your own files with <code>libcuckoo</code>, always remember to enable C++11 features on your compiler. On <code>g++</code>, this would be <code>-std=c++11</code>, and on <code>clang++</code>, this would be <code>-std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++</code>.</p>
<p>Once you have installed the header files and the install location has been added to your search path, you can include <code>&lt;libcuckoo/cuckoohash_map.hh&gt;</code>, and any of the other headers you installed, into your source file.</p>
<p>There is also a C wrapper around the table that can be leveraged to use <code>libcuckoo</code> in a C program. The interface consists of a template header and implementation file that can be used to generate instances of the hashtable for different key-value types.</p>
<p>See the <code>examples</code> directory for a demonstration of all of these features.</p>
<h1 id="tests">Tests</h1>
<p>The <code>tests</code> directory contains a number of tests and benchmarks of the hash table, which also can serve as useful examples of how to use the table's various features. Make sure to enable the tests you want to build with the corresponding <code>CMake</code> flags. The test suite can be run with the <code>make test</code> command. The test executables can be run individually as well.</p>
