<p>jbig2dec is a decoder library and example utility implementing the JBIG2 bi-level image compression spec. Also known as ITU T.88 and ISO IEC 14492, and included by reference in Adobe's PDF version 1.4 and later.</p>
<p>The basic invocation is:</p>
<pre><code>jbig2dec [-o &lt;output file&gt;] file.jbig2</code></pre>
<p>It also supports separate 'global' and 'page' streams, generally extracted from some embedded format:</p>
<pre><code>jbig2dec [-o &lt;output file&gt;] &lt;global_stream&gt; &lt;page_stream&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The program is only partially functional at this time, but should be useful in some limited contexts. We welcome files that the decoder can't handle, or renders incorrectly.</p>
<p>A set of example files is available from http://www.ece.ubc.ca/spmg/jbig2/bitstreams/main.html</p>
