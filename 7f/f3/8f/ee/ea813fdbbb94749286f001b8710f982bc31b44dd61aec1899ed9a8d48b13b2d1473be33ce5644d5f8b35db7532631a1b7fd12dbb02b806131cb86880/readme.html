<h1 id="mimalloc">mimalloc</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>mimalloc (pronounced &quot;me-malloc&quot;) is a general purpose allocator with excellent <a href="#performance">performance</a> characteristics. Initially developed by Daan Leijen for the run-time systems of the <a href="https://github.com/koka-lang/koka">Koka</a> and <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean">Lean</a> languages.</p>
<p>It is a drop-in replacement for <code>malloc</code> and can be used in other programs without code changes, for example, on Unix you can use it as:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; LD_PRELOAD=/usr/bin/libmimalloc.so  myprogram</code></pre>
<p>Notable aspects of the design include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>small and consistent</strong>: the library is less than 3500 LOC using simple and consistent data structures. This makes it very suitable to integrate and adapt in other projects. For runtime systems it provides hooks for a monotonic <em>heartbeat</em> and deferred freeing (for bounded worst-case times with reference counting).</li>
<li><strong>free list sharding</strong>: the big idea: instead of one big free list (per size class) we have many smaller lists per memory &quot;page&quot; which both reduces fragmentation and increases locality -- things that are allocated close in time get allocated close in memory. (A memory &quot;page&quot; in <em>mimalloc</em> contains blocks of one size class and is usually 64KiB on a 64-bit system).</li>
<li><strong>eager page reset</strong>: when a &quot;page&quot; becomes empty (with increased chance due to free list sharding) the memory is marked to the OS as unused (&quot;reset&quot; or &quot;purged&quot;) reducing (real) memory pressure and fragmentation, especially in long running programs.</li>
<li><strong>secure</strong>: <em>mimalloc</em> can be built in secure mode, adding guard pages, randomized allocation, encrypted free lists, etc. to protect against various heap vulnerabilities. The performance penalty is only around 3% on average over our benchmarks.</li>
<li><strong>first-class heaps</strong>: efficiently create and use multiple heaps to allocate across different regions. A heap can be destroyed at once instead of deallocating each object separately.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>bounded</strong>: it does not suffer from <em>blowup</em> [1], has bounded worst-case allocation times (<em>wcat</em>), bounded space overhead (~0.2% meta-data, with at most 16.7% waste in allocation sizes), and has no internal points of contention using only atomic operations.</li>
<li><strong>fast</strong>: In our benchmarks (see <a href="#performance">below</a>), <em>mimalloc</em> always outperforms all other leading allocators (<em>jemalloc</em>, <em>tcmalloc</em>, <em>Hoard</em>, etc), and usually uses less memory (up to 25% more in the worst case). A nice property is that it does consistently well over a wide range of benchmarks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/mimalloc">documentation</a> gives a full overview of the API. You can read more on the design of <em>mimalloc</em> in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/mimalloc-free-list-sharding-in-action">technical report</a> which also has detailed benchmark results.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<h1 id="building">Building</h1>
<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>
<p>Open <code>ide/vs2017/mimalloc.sln</code> in Visual Studio 2017 and build. The <code>mimalloc</code> project builds a static library (in <code>out/msvc-x64</code>), while the <code>mimalloc-override</code> project builds a DLL for overriding malloc in the entire program.</p>
<h2 id="macos-linux-bsd-etc.">macOS, Linux, BSD, etc.</h2>
<p>We use <a href="https://cmake.org"><code>cmake</code></a><sup>1</sup> as the build system:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mkdir -p out/release
&gt; cd out/release
&gt; cmake ../..
&gt; make</code></pre>
<p>This builds the library as a shared (dynamic) library (<code>.so</code> or <code>.dylib</code>), a static library (<code>.a</code>), and as a single object file (<code>.o</code>).</p>
<p><code>&gt; sudo make install</code> (install the library and header files in <code>/usr/local/lib</code> and <code>/usr/local/include</code>)</p>
<p>You can build the debug version which does many internal checks and maintains detailed statistics as:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mkdir -p out/debug
&gt; cd out/debug
&gt; cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../..
&gt; make</code></pre>
<p>This will name the shared library as <code>libmimalloc-debug.so</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, you can build a <em>secure</em> version that uses guard pages, encrypted free lists, etc, as:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mkdir -p out/secure
&gt; cd out/secure
&gt; cmake -DMI_SECURE=ON ../..
&gt; make</code></pre>
<p>This will name the shared library as <code>libmimalloc-secure.so</code>. Use <code>ccmake</code><sup>2</sup> instead of <code>cmake</code> to see and customize all the available build options.</p>
<p>Notes: 1. Install CMake: <code>sudo apt-get install cmake</code> 2. Install CCMake: <code>sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui</code></p>
<h1 id="using-the-library">Using the library</h1>
<p>The preferred usage is including <code>&lt;mimalloc.h&gt;</code>, linking with the shared- or static library, and using the <code>mi_malloc</code> API exclusively for allocation. For example,</p>
<pre><code>gcc -o myprogram -lmimalloc myfile.c</code></pre>
<p>mimalloc uses only safe OS calls (<code>mmap</code> and <code>VirtualAlloc</code>) and can co-exist with other allocators linked to the same program. If you use <code>cmake</code>, you can simply use:</p>
<pre><code>find_package(mimalloc 1.0 REQUIRED)</code></pre>
<p>in your <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> to find a locally installed mimalloc. Then use either:</p>
<pre><code>target_link_libraries(myapp PUBLIC mimalloc)</code></pre>
<p>to link with the shared (dynamic) library, or:</p>
<pre><code>target_link_libraries(myapp PUBLIC mimalloc-static)</code></pre>
<p>to link with the static library. See <code>test\CMakeLists.txt</code> for an example.</p>
<p>You can pass environment variables to print verbose messages (<code>MIMALLOC_VERBOSE=1</code>) and statistics (<code>MIMALLOC_SHOW_STATS=1</code>) (in the debug version):</p>
<pre><code>&gt; env MIMALLOC_SHOW_STATS=1 ./cfrac 175451865205073170563711388363

<p>The above model of using the <code>mi_</code> prefixed API is not always possible though in existing programs that already use the standard malloc interface, and another option is to override the standard malloc interface completely and redirect all calls to the <em>mimalloc</em> library instead.</p>
<h1 id="overriding-malloc">Overriding Malloc</h1>
<p>Overriding the standard <code>malloc</code> can be done either <em>dynamically</em> or <em>statically</em>.</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-override">Dynamic override</h2>
<p>This is the recommended way to override the standard malloc interface.</p>
<h3 id="unix-bsd-macos">Unix, BSD, macOS</h3>
<p>On these systems we preload the mimalloc shared library so all calls to the standard <code>malloc</code> interface are resolved to the <em>mimalloc</em> library.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>env LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libmimalloc.so myprogram</code> (on Linux, BSD, etc.)</li>
<li><code>env DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=usr/lib/libmimalloc.dylib myprogram</code> (On macOS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note certain security restrictions may apply when doing this from the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43941322/dyld-insert-libraries-ignored-when-calling-application-through-bash">shell</a>.</p>
<p>You can set extra environment variables to check that mimalloc is running, like:</p>
<pre><code>env MIMALLOC_VERBOSE=1 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libmimalloc.so myprogram</code></pre>
<p>or run with the debug version to get detailed statistics:</p>
<pre><code>env MIMALLOC_SHOW_STATS=1 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libmimalloc-debug.so myprogram</code></pre>
<h3 id="windows-1">Windows</h3>
<p>On Windows you need to link your program explicitly with the mimalloc DLL, and use the C-runtime library as a DLL (the <code>/MD</code> or <code>/MDd</code> switch). To ensure the mimalloc DLL gets loaded it is easiest to insert some call to the mimalloc API in the <code>main</code> function, like <code>mi_version()</code>.</p>
<p>Due to the way mimalloc intercepts the standard malloc at runtime, it is best to link to the mimalloc import library first on the command line so it gets loaded right after the universal C runtime DLL (<code>ucrtbase</code>). See the <code>mimalloc-override-test</code> project for an example.</p>
<h2 id="static-override">Static override</h2>
<p>On Unix systems, you can also statically link with <em>mimalloc</em> to override the standard malloc interface. The recommended way is to link the final program with the <em>mimalloc</em> single object file (<code>mimalloc-override.o</code>). We use an object file instead of a library file as linkers give preference to that over archives to resolve symbols. To ensure that the standard malloc interface resolves to the <em>mimalloc</em> library, link it as the first object file. For example:</p>
<pre><code>gcc -o myprogram mimalloc-override.o  myfile1.c ...</code></pre>
<h1 id="performance">Performance</h1>
<p>We tested <em>mimalloc</em> against many other top allocators over a wide range of benchmarks, ranging from various real world programs to synthetic benchmarks that see how the allocator behaves under more extreme circumstances.</p>
<p>In our benchmarks, <em>mimalloc</em> always outperforms all other leading allocators (<em>jemalloc</em>, <em>tcmalloc</em>, <em>Hoard</em>, etc), and usually uses less memory (up to 25% more in the worst case). A nice property is that it does <em>consistently</em> well over the wide range of benchmarks.</p>
<p>Allocators are interesting as there exists no algorithm that is generally optimal -- for a given allocator one can usually construct a workload where it does not do so well. The goal is thus to find an allocation strategy that performs well over a wide range of benchmarks without suffering from underperformance in less common situations (which is what the second half of our benchmark set tests for).</p>
<p>We show here only the results on an AMD EPYC system (Apr 2019) -- for specific details and further benchmarks we refer to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/mimalloc-free-list-sharding-in-action">technical report</a>.</p>
<p>The benchmark suite is scripted and available separately as <a href="https://github.com/daanx/mimalloc-bench">mimalloc-bench</a>.</p>
<h2 id="benchmark-results">Benchmark Results</h2>
<p>Testing on a big Amazon EC2 instance (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">r5a.4xlarge</a>) consisting of a 16-core AMD EPYC 7000 at 2.5GHz with 128GB ECC memory, running Ubuntu 18.04.1 with LibC 2.27 and GCC 7.3.0. The measured allocators are <em>mimalloc</em> (mi), Google's <a href="https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools"><em>tcmalloc</em></a> (tc) used in Chrome, <a href="https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc"><em>jemalloc</em></a> (je) by Jason Evans used in Firefox and FreeBSD, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/snmalloc"><em>snmalloc</em></a> (sn) by Liétar et al.

<p>(note: the <em>xmalloc-testN</em> memory usage should be disregarded as it allocates more the faster the program runs).</p>
<p>In the first five benchmarks we can see <em>mimalloc</em> outperforms the other allocators moderately, but we also see that all these modern allocators perform well -- the times of large performance differences in regular workloads are over :-). In <em>cfrac</em> and <em>espresso</em>, <em>mimalloc</em> is a tad faster than <em>tcmalloc</em> and <em>jemalloc</em>, but a solid 10% faster than all other allocators on <em>espresso</em>. The <em>tbb</em> allocator does not do so well here and lags more than 20% behind <em>mimalloc</em>. The <em>cfrac</em> and <em>espresso</em> programs do not use much memory (~1.5MB) so it does not matter too much, but still <em>mimalloc</em> uses about half the resident memory of <em>tcmalloc</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>leanN</em> program is most interesting as a large realistic and concurrent workload of the <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean">Lean</a> theorem prover compiling its own standard library, and there is a 8% speedup over <em>tcmalloc</em>. This is quite significant: if Lean spends 20% of its time in the allocator that means that <em>mimalloc</em> is 1.3× faster than <em>tcmalloc</em> here. (This is surprising as that is not measured in a pure allocation benchmark like <em>alloc-test</em>. We conjecture that we see this outsized improvement here because <em>mimalloc</em> has better locality in the allocation which improves performance for the <em>other</em> computations in a program as well).</p>
<p>The <em>redis</em> benchmark shows more differences between the allocators where <em>mimalloc</em> is 14% faster than <em>jemalloc</em>. On this benchmark <em>tbb</em> (and <em>Hoard</em>) do not do well and are over 40% slower.</p>
<p>The <em>larson</em> server workload allocates and frees objects between many threads. Larson and Krishnan [2] observe this behavior (which they call <em>bleeding</em>) in actual server applications, and the benchmark simulates this. Here, <em>mimalloc</em> is more than 2.5× faster than <em>tcmalloc</em> and <em>jemalloc</em> due to the object migration between different threads. This is a difficult benchmark for other allocators too where <em>mimalloc</em> is still 48% faster than the next fastest (<em>snmalloc</em>).</p>
<p>The second benchmark set tests specific aspects of the allocators and shows even more extreme differences between them.</p>
<p>The <em>alloc-test</em>, by <a href="http://ithare.com/testing-memory-allocators-ptmalloc2-tcmalloc-hoard-jemalloc-while-trying-to-simulate-real-world-loads/">OLogN Technologies AG</a>, is a very allocation intensive benchmark doing millions of allocations in various size classes. The test is scaled such that when an allocator performs almost identically on <em>alloc-test1</em> as <em>alloc-testN</em> it means that it scales linearly. Here, <em>tcmalloc</em>, <em>snmalloc</em>, and <em>Hoard</em> seem to scale less well and do more than 10% worse on the multi-core version. Even the best allocators (<em>tcmalloc</em> and <em>jemalloc</em>) are more than 10% slower as <em>mimalloc</em> here.</p>
<p>The <em>sh6bench</em> and <em>sh8bench</em> benchmarks are developed by <a href="http://www.microquill.com/">MicroQuill</a> as part of SmartHeap. In <em>sh6bench</em> <em>mimalloc</em> does much better than the others (more than 2× faster than <em>jemalloc</em>). We cannot explain this well but believe it is caused in part by the &quot;reverse&quot; free-ing pattern in <em>sh6bench</em>. Again in <em>sh8bench</em> the <em>mimalloc</em> allocator handles object migration between threads much better and is over 36% faster than the next best allocator, <em>snmalloc</em>. Whereas <em>tcmalloc</em> did well on <em>sh6bench</em>, the addition of object migration caused it to be almost 3 times slower than before.</p>
<p>The <em>xmalloc-testN</em> benchmark by Lever and Boreham [5] and Christian Eder, simulates an asymmetric workload where some threads only allocate, and others only free. The <em>snmalloc</em> allocator was especially developed to handle this case well as it often occurs in concurrent message passing systems (like the [Pony] language for which <em>snmalloc</em> was initially developed). Here we see that the <em>mimalloc</em> technique of having non-contended sharded thread free lists pays off as it even outperforms <em>snmalloc</em> here. Only <em>jemalloc</em> also handles this reasonably well, while the others underperform by a large margin.</p>
<p>The <em>cache-scratch</em> benchmark by Emery Berger [1], and introduced with the Hoard allocator to test for <em>passive-false</em> sharing of cache lines. With a single thread they all perform the same, but when running with multiple threads the potential allocator induced false sharing of the cache lines causes large run-time differences, where <em>mimalloc</em> is more than 18× faster than <em>jemalloc</em> and <em>tcmalloc</em>! Crundal [6] describes in detail why the false cache line sharing occurs in the <em>tcmalloc</em> design, and also discusses how this can be avoided with some small implementation changes. Only <em>snmalloc</em> and <em>tbb</em> also avoid the cache line sharing like <em>mimalloc</em>. Kukanov and Voss [7] describe in detail how the design of <em>tbb</em> avoids the false cache line sharing.</p>
