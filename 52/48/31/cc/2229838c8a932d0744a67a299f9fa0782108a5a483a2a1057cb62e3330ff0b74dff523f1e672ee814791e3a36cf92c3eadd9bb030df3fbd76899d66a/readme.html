<h1 id="about-libxcb">About libxcb</h1>
<p>libxcb provides an interface to the X Window System protocol, which replaces the current Xlib interface. It has several advantages over Xlib, including: - size: small, simple library, and lower memory footprint - latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later - direct protocol access: interface and protocol correspond exactly - proven thread support: transparently access XCB from multiple threads - easy extension implementation: interfaces auto-generated from XML-XCB</p>
<p>Xlib can also use XCB as a transport layer, allowing software to make requests and receive responses with both, which eases porting to XCB. However, client programs, libraries, and toolkits will gain the most benefit from a native XCB port.</p>
