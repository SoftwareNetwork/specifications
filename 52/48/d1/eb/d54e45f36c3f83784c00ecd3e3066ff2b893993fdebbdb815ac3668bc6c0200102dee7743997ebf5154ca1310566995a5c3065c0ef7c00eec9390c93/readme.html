<p>Xorshift are a family of pseudo-random number generators (RNG) invented by Marsaglia.</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift</p>
<p>We present a vectorized version of xorshift128+, a popular random-number generator part of this family. It is written in C. The implementation uses Intel's SIMD instructions and is based on Vigna's original (pure C) implementation.</p>
<p>As a random number generator, xorshift128+ is not very strong. <a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2017/09/08/the-xorshift128-random-number-generator-fails-bigcrush/">It fails statistical tests such as BigCrush</a>. It should never be used alone in applications where the quality of the random numbers matters a great deal. However, when you just want fast and &quot;good enough&quot; random numbers, it should do well.</p>
<p>Since speed is the primary benefit of xorshift128+, then it is tempting to accelerate it further using vector instructions.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h2>
<p>You should have a recent Intel processor (Haswell or better). If you bought your PC before everyone on Earth had a smartphone, it is probably too old a PC. Please upgrade.</p>
<p>Your compiler supports C99, right? C99 stands for 1999. That was almost 20 years ago.</p>

<h2 id="shallow-analysis">Shallow analysis</h2>
<p>SIMD random-number generation is something like twice as fast as plain C random number generation. However on algorithms such as random shuffling, the benefits of faster random number generation are lesser because other bottlenecks arise.</p>
<p>For the most part however, the application of SIMD instructions for random number generation is &quot;free&quot; if the CPU supports it.</p>
