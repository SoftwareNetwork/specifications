<p>libsigc++ -- The Typesafe Callback Framework for C++</p>
<p>General information:</p>
<p>libsigc++ implements a typesafe callback system for standard C++. It allows you to define signals and to connect those signals to any callback function, either global or a member function, regardless of whether it is static or virtual.</p>
<p>libsigc++ is used by gtkmm to wrap the GTK+ signal system. It does not depend on GTK+ or gtkmm.</p>
<p>Further information is available on the libsigc++ project home page: https://libsigcplusplus.github.io/libsigcplusplus/</p>
<p>License information:</p>
<p>Distribution of library and components is under the LGPL as listed in the file COPYING. Examples and tests are Public Domain.</p>

<p>Compatibility:</p>
<p>Compatible compilers must support C++11, such as the decltype() specifier.</p>
<p>All releases are tested with the gcc (g++) compiler.</p>

<p>Whenever possible, you should use the official binary packages approved by the supplier of your operating system, such as your Linux distribution.</p>

<h2 id="building-from-a-release-tarball">Building from a release tarball</h2>
<p>It's easiest to build with Meson, if the tarball was made with Meson, and to build with Autotools, if the tarball was made with Autotools. Then you don't have to use maintainer-mode.</p>
<p>How do you know how the tarball was made? If it was made with Meson, it contains files in untracked/build_scripts/, untracked/docs/ and possibly other subdirectories of untracked/.</p>

<p>Don't call the builddir 'build'. There is a directory called 'build' with files used by Autotools.</p>
<p>If the tarball was made with Autotools, you must enable maintainer-mode: $ meson --prefix=/some_directory --libdir=lib -Dmaintainer-mode=true your_builddir . If the tarball was made with Meson: $ meson --prefix=/some_directory --libdir=lib your_builddir .</p>
<p>Then $ cd your_builddir $ ninja $ ninja install You can run the tests like so: $ ninja test</p>
<h3 id="building-from-a-tarball-with-autotools">Building from a tarball with Autotools</h3>
<p>If the tarball was made with Autotools: $ ./configure --prefix=/some_directory If the tarball was made with Meson, you must enable maintainer-mode: $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/some_directory</p>
<p>Then $ make $ make install You can build the examples and tests, and run the tests, like so: $ make check</p>
<h2 id="building-from-git">Building from git</h2>
<p>Building from git can be difficult so you should prefer building from a release tarball unless you need to work on the libsigc++ code itself.</p>
<p>jhbuild can be a good help https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/jhbuild https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Jhbuild</p>

<p>Maintainer-mode is enabled by default when you build from a git clone.</p>
<p>Don't call the builddir 'build'. There is a directory called 'build' with files used by Autotools.</p>
<p>$ meson --prefix=/some_directory --libdir=lib your_builddir . $ cd your_builddir $ ninja $ ninja install You can run the tests like so: $ ninja test You can create a tarball like so: $ ninja dist</p>
<h3 id="building-from-git-with-autotools">Building from git with Autotools</h3>
<p>$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/some_directory $ make $ make install You can build the examples and tests, and run the tests, like so: $ make check You can create a tarball like so: $ make distcheck or $ make dist</p>
