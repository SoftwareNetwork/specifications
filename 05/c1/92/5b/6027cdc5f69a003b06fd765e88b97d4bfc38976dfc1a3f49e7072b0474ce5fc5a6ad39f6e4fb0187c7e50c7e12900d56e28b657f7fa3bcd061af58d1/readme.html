<p>SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator)</p>
<p>Tagline: SWIG is a compiler that integrates C and C++ with languages
including Perl, Python, Tcl, Ruby, PHP, Java, C#, D, Go, Lua, Octave, R,
Scheme (Guile, MzScheme/Racket), Scilab, Ocaml. SWIG can also export its
parse tree into XML.</p>
<p>SWIG reads annotated C/C++ header files and creates wrapper code
(glue code) in order to make the corresponding C/C++ libraries available
to the listed languages, or to extend C/C++ programs with a scripting
language.</p>
<p>Up-to-date SWIG related information can be found at</p>
<pre><code>    https://www.swig.org</code></pre>
<p>A SWIG FAQ and other hints can be found on the SWIG Wiki:</p>
<pre><code>    https://github.com/swig/swig/wiki</code></pre>
<h1 id="license">License</h1>
<p>Please see the LICENSE file for details of the SWIG license. For
further insight into the license including the license of SWIG’s output
code, please visit</p>
<pre><code>    https://www.swig.org/legal.html</code></pre>
<h1 id="release-notes">Release Notes</h1>
<p>Please see the CHANGES.current file for a detailed list of bug fixes
and new features for the current release. The CHANGES file contains bug
fixes and new features for older versions. A summary of changes in each
release can be found in the RELEASENOTES file.</p>
<h1 id="documentation">Documentation</h1>
<p>The Doc/Manual directory contains the most recent set of updated
documentation for this release. The documentation is available in three
different formats, each of which contains identical content. These
format are, pdf (Doc/Manual/SWIGDocumentation.pdf), single page html
(Doc/Manual/SWIGDocumentation.html) or multiple page html (other files
in Doc/Manual). Please select your chosen format and copy/install to
wherever takes your fancy.</p>
<p>There is some technical developer documentation available in the
Doc/Devel subdirectory. This is not necessarily up-to-date, but it has
some information on SWIG internals.</p>
<p>Documentation is also online at https://www.swig.org/doc.html.</p>
<h1 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</h1>
<p>The developers strive their best to preserve backwards compatibility
between releases, but this is not always possible as the overriding aim
is to provide the best wrapping experience. Where backwards
compatibility is known to be broken, it is clearly marked as an
incompatibility in the CHANGES and CHANGES.current files.</p>
<p>See the documentation for details of the SWIG_VERSION preprocessor
symbol if you have backward compatibility issues and need to use more
than one version of SWIG.</p>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p>Please read the Doc/Manual/Preface.html#Preface_installation for full
installation instructions for Windows, Unix and Mac OS X using the
release tarball/zip file. The INSTALL file has generic build and
installation instructions for Unix users. Users wishing to build and
install code from Github should visit https://swig.org/svn.html to
obtain the more detailed instructions required for building code
obtained from Github - extra steps are required compared to building
from the release tarball.</p>
<h1 id="testing">Testing</h1>
<p>The typical ‘make -k check’ can be performed on Unix operating
systems. Please read Doc/Manual/Preface.html#Preface_testing for
details.</p>
<h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>
<p>The Examples directory contains a variety of examples of using SWIG
and it has some browsable documentation. Simply point your browser to
the file “Example/index.html”.</p>
<p>The Examples directory also includes Visual C++ project 6 (.dsp)
files for building some of the examples on Windows. Later versions of
Visual Studio will convert these old style project files into a current
solution file.</p>
<h1 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h1>
<p>There are minor known bugs, details of which are in the bug tracker,
see https://www.swig.org/bugs.html.</p>
<h1 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h1>
<p>In order to operate correctly, SWIG relies upon a set of library
files. If after building SWIG, you get error messages like this,</p>
<pre><code>$ swig foo.i
:1. Unable to find &#39;swig.swg&#39;
:3. Unable to find &#39;tcl8.swg&#39;</code></pre>
<p>it means that SWIG has either been incorrectly configured or
installed. To fix this:</p>
<pre><code>1.  Make sure you remembered to do a &#39;make install&#39; and that
    the installation actually worked.  Make sure you have
    write permission on the install directory.

2.  If that doesn&#39;t work, type &#39;swig -swiglib&#39; to find out
    where SWIG thinks its library is located.

3.  If the location is not where you expect, perhaps
    you supplied a bad option to configure.  Use
    ./configure --prefix=pathname to set the SWIG install
    location.   Also, make sure you don&#39;t include a shell
    escape character such as ~ when you specify the path.

4.  The SWIG library can be changed by setting the SWIG_LIB
    environment variable.  However, you really shouldn&#39;t
    have to do this.</code></pre>
