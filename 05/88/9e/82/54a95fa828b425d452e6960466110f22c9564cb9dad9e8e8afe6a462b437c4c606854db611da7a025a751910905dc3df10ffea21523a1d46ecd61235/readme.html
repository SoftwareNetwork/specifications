<p>pugixml is a C++ XML processing library, which consists of a DOM-like interface with rich traversal/modification capabilities, an extremely fast XML parser which constructs the DOM tree from an XML file/buffer, and an XPath 1.0 implementation for complex data-driven tree queries. Full Unicode support is also available, with Unicode interface variants and conversions between different Unicode encodings (which happen automatically during parsing/saving).</p>
<p>pugixml is used by a lot of projects, both open-source and proprietary, for performance and easy-to-use interface.</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>Documentation for the current release of pugixml is available on-line as two separate documents:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://pugixml.org/docs/quickstart.html">Quick-start guide</a>, that aims to provide enough information to start using the library;</li>
<li><a href="http://pugixml.org/docs/manual.html">Complete reference manual</a>, that describes all features of the library in detail.</li>
</ul>
<p>Youâ€™re advised to start with the quick-start guide; however, many important library features are either not described in it at all or only mentioned briefly; if you require more information you should read the complete manual.</p>
