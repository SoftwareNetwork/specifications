<h1 id="range-v3">range-v3</h1>
<p>Range library for C++14/17/20. This code was the basis of <a href="https://ericniebler.github.io/std/wg21/D4128.html">a formal proposal</a> to add range support to the C++ standard library. That proposal evolved through a Technical Specification, and finally into <a href="https://wg21.link/p0896r4">P0896R4 &quot;The One Ranges Proposal&quot;</a> which was merged into the C++20 working drafts in November 2018.</p>
<h2 id="about">About:</h2>
<p>Ranges are an extension of the Standard Template Library that makes its iterators and algorithms more powerful by making them <em>composable</em>. Unlike other range-like solutions which seek to do away with iterators, in range-v3 ranges are an abstration layer <em>on top</em> of iterators.</p>
<p>Range-v3 is built on three pillars: Views, Actions, and Algorithms. The algorithms are the same as those with which you are already familiar in the STL, except that in range-v3 all the algorithms have overloads that take ranges in addition to the overloads that take iterators. Views are composable adaptations of ranges where the adaptation happens lazily as the view is iterated. And an action is an eager application of an algorithm to a container that mutates the container in-place and returns it for further processing.</p>
<p>Views and actions use the pipe syntax (e.g., <code>rng | adapt1 | adapt2 | ...</code>) so your code is terse and readable from left to right.</p>

<h2 id="supported-compilers">Supported Compilers</h2>
<p>The code is known to work on the following compilers:</p>
<ul>
<li>clang 3.9 (or later)</li>
<li>GCC 6.5 (or later)</li>
<li>Clang/LLVM 6 (or later) on Windows (older versions may work - we haven't tested.)</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2019 (or later) on Windows, with some caveats due to range-v3's strict conformance requirements:</li>
<li>range-v3 needs <code>/std:c++latest /permissive-</code></li>
<li>range-v3 needs a fully conforming preprocessor, so <code>/experimental:preprocessor</code> is necessary. Note that the conforming preprocessor diagnoses <code>C5105</code> &quot;macro expansion producing 'defined' has undefined behavior&quot; in some of the Windows SDK headers, so you'll probably want to suppress that warning with <code>/wd5105</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>[ Note: We've &quot;retired&quot; support for Clang/C2 with the VS2015 toolset (i.e., the <code>v140_clang_c2</code> toolset) which Microsoft no longer supports for C++ use. We no longer have CI runs, but haven't gone out of our way to break anything, so it will likely continue to work. ]</p>
<p><strong>Development Status:</strong> This code is fairly stable, well-tested, and suitable for casual use, although currently lacking documentation. <em>In general</em>, no promise is made about support or long-term stability. This code <em>will</em> evolve without regard to backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>A notable exception is anything found within the <code>ranges::cpp20</code> namespace. Those components will change rarely or (preferably) never at all.</p>
