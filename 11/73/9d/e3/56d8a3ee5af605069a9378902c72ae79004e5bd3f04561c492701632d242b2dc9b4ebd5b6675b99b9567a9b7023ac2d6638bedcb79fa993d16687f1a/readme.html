<h1 id="welcome-to-libarchive">Welcome to libarchive!</h1>
<p>The libarchive project develops a portable, efficient C library that
can read and write streaming archives in a variety of formats. It also
includes implementations of the common <code>tar</code>,
<code>cpio</code>, and <code>zcat</code> command-line tools that use the
libarchive library.</p>

<h2 id="notes-about-the-library-design">Notes about the Library
Design</h2>
<p>The following notes address many of the most common questions we are
asked about libarchive:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a heavily stream-oriented system. That means that it is
optimized to read or write the archive in a single pass from beginning
to end. For example, this allows libarchive to process archives too
large to store on disk by processing them on-the-fly as they are read
from or written to a network or tape drive. This also makes libarchive
useful for tools that need to produce archives on-the-fly (such as
webservers that provide archived contents of a users account).</p></li>
<li><p>In-place modification and random access to the contents of an
archive are not directly supported. For some formats, this is not an
issue: For example, tar.gz archives are not designed for random access.
In some other cases, libarchive can re-open an archive and scan it from
the beginning quickly enough to provide the needed abilities even
without true random access. Of course, some applications do require true
random access; those applications should consider alternatives to
libarchive.</p></li>
<li><p>The library is designed to be extended with new compression and
archive formats. The only requirement is that the format be readable or
writable as a stream and that each archive entry be independent. There
are articles on the libarchive Wiki explaining how to extend
libarchive.</p></li>
<li><p>On read, compression and format are always detected
automatically.</p></li>
<li><p>The same API is used for all formats; it should be very easy for
software using libarchive to transparently handle any of libarchive’s
archiving formats.</p></li>
<li><p>Libarchive’s automatic support for decompression can be used
without archiving by explicitly selecting the “raw” and “empty”
formats.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve attempted to minimize static link pollution. If you don’t
explicitly invoke a particular feature (such as support for a particular
compression or format), it won’t get pulled in to statically-linked
programs. In particular, if you don’t explicitly enable a particular
compression or decompression support, you won’t need to link against the
corresponding compression or decompression libraries. This also reduces
the size of statically-linked binaries in environments where that
matters.</p></li>
<li><p>The library is generally <em>thread-safe</em> depending on the
platform: it does not define any global variables of its own. However,
some platforms do not provide fully thread-safe versions of key C
library functions. On those platforms, libarchive will use the
non-thread-safe functions. Patches to improve this are of great interest
to us.</p></li>
<li><p>The function <code>archive_write_disk_header()</code> is
<em>not</em> thread safe on POSIX machines and could lead to security
issue resulting in world writeable directories. Thus it must be mutexed
by the calling code. This is due to calling
<code>umask(oldumask = umask(0))</code>, which sets the umask for the
whole process to 0 for a short time frame. In case other thread calls
the same function in parallel, it might get interrupted by it and cause
the executable to use umask=0 for the remaining execution. This will
then lead to implicitly created directories to have 777 permissions
without sticky bit.</p></li>
<li><p>In particular, libarchive’s modules to read or write a directory
tree do use <code>chdir()</code> to optimize the directory traversals.
This can cause problems for programs that expect to do disk access from
multiple threads. Of course, those modules are completely optional and
you can use the rest of libarchive without them.</p></li>
<li><p>The library is <em>not</em> thread-aware, however. It does no
locking or thread management of any kind. If you create a libarchive
object and need to access it from multiple threads, you will need to
provide your own locking.</p></li>
<li><p>On read, the library accepts whatever blocks you hand it. Your
read callback is free to pass the library a byte at a time or mmap the
entire archive and give it to the library at once. On write, the library
always produces correctly-blocked output.</p></li>
<li><p>The object-style approach allows you to have multiple archive
streams open at once. bsdtar uses this in its “<span class="citation"
data-cites="archive">@archive</span>” extension.</p></li>
<li><p>The archive itself is read/written using callback functions. You
can read an archive directly from an in-memory buffer or write it to a
socket, if you wish. There are some utility functions to provide
easy-to-use “open file,” etc, capabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>The read/write APIs are designed to allow individual entries to
be read or written to any data source: You can create a block of data in
memory and add it to a tar archive without first writing a temporary
file. You can also read an entry from an archive and write the data
directly to a socket. If you want to read/write entries to disk, there
are convenience functions to make this especially easy.</p></li>
<li><p>Note: The “pax interchange format” is a POSIX standard extended
tar format that should be used when the older <em>ustar</em> format is
not appropriate. It has many advantages over other tar formats
(including the legacy GNU tar format) and is widely supported by current
tar implementations.</p></li>
</ul>
