<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The Hardware Locality (hwloc) software project aims at easing the process of discovering hardware resources in parallel architectures. It offers command-line tools and a C API for consulting these resources, their locality, attributes, and interconnection. hwloc primarily aims at helping high-performance computing (HPC) applications, but is also applicable to any project seeking to exploit code and/or data locality on modern computing platforms.</p>
<p>hwloc is actually made of two subprojects distributed together:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original hwloc project for describing the internals of computing nodes. It is described in details starting at section Hardware Locality (hwloc) Introduction.</li>
<li>The network-oriented companion called netloc (Network Locality), described in details starting with section Network Locality (netloc).</li>
</ul>
<p>See also the Related pages tab above for links to other sections.</p>
<p>Netloc may be disabled, but the original hwloc cannot. Both hwloc and netloc APIs are documented after these sections.</p>
<p>Installation</p>
<p>hwloc (https://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/) is available under the BSD license. It is hosted as a sub-project of the overall Open MPI project (https:/ /www.open-mpi.org/). Note that hwloc does not require any functionality from Open MPI – it is a wholly separate (and much smaller!) project and code base. It just happens to be hosted as part of the overall Open MPI project.</p>
<p>Basic Installation</p>
<p>Installation is the fairly common GNU-based process:</p>
<p>shell$ ./configure –prefix=… shell$ make shell$ make install</p>
<p>hwloc- and netloc-specific configure options and requirements are documented in sections hwloc Installation and Netloc Installation respectively.</p>
<p>Also note that if you install supplemental libraries in non-standard locations, hwloc’s configure script may not be able to find them without some help. You may need to specify additional CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS, or PKG_CONFIG_PATH values on the configure command line.</p>
<p>For example, if libpciaccess was installed into /opt/pciaccess, hwloc’s configure script may not find it be default. Try adding PKG_CONFIG_PATH to the ./configure command line, like this:</p>
<p>./configure PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/pciaccess/lib/pkgconfig …</p>
<p>Running the “lstopo” tool is a good way to check as a graphical output whether hwloc properly detected the architecture of your node. Netloc command-line tools can be used to display the network topology interconnecting your nodes.</p>
<p>Installing from a Git clone</p>
<p>Additionally, the code can be directly cloned from Git:</p>
<p>shell$ git clone https://github.com/open-mpi/hwloc.git shell$ cd hwloc shell$ ./autogen.sh</p>
<p>Note that GNU Autoconf &gt;=2.63, Automake &gt;=1.11 and Libtool &gt;=2.2.6 are required when building from a Git clone.</p>
<p>Nightly development snapshots are available on the web site, they can be configured and built without any need for Git or GNU Autotools.</p>
<p>Questions and Bugs</p>
<p>Bugs should be reported in the tracker (https://github.com/open-mpi/hwloc/ issues). Opening a new issue automatically displays lots of hints about how to debug and report issues.</p>
<p>Questions may be sent to the users or developers mailing lists (https:// www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/hwloc.php).</p>
<p>There is also a #hwloc IRC channel on Freenode (irc.freenode.net).</p>
<p>See https://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/doc/ for more hwloc documentation.</p>
