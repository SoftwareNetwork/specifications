development, see the <a href="https://devguide.python.org/">Developer

<h2 id="using-python">Using Python</h2>
<p>Installable Python kits, and information about using Python, are
available at <a href="https://www.python.org/">python.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="build-instructions">Build Instructions</h2>
<p>On Unix, Linux, BSD, macOS, and Cygwin:</p>
<pre><code>./configure
make
make test
sudo make install</code></pre>
<p>This will install Python as <code>python3</code>.</p>
<p>You can pass many options to the configure script; run
<code>./configure --help</code> to find out more. On macOS
case-insensitive file systems and on Cygwin, the executable is called
<code>python.exe</code>; elsewhere it's just <code>python</code>.</p>
<p>Building a complete Python installation requires the use of various
additional third-party libraries, depending on your build platform and
configure options. Not all standard library modules are buildable or
useable on all platforms. Refer to the <a
href="https://devguide.python.org/setup/#install-dependencies">Install
dependencies</a> section of the <a
href="https://devguide.python.org/">Developer Guide</a> for current
detailed information on dependencies for various Linux distributions and
macOS.</p>
<p>On macOS, there are additional configure and build options related to
macOS framework and universal builds. Refer to <a
href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Mac/README.rst">Mac/README.rst</a>.</p>
<p>On Windows, see <a
href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/PCbuild/readme.txt">PCbuild/readme.txt</a>.</p>
<p>If you wish, you can create a subdirectory and invoke configure from
there. For example:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir debug
cd debug
../configure --with-pydebug
make
make test</code></pre>
<p>(This will fail if you <em>also</em> built at the top-level
directory. You should do a <code>make clean</code> at the top-level
first.)</p>
<p>To get an optimized build of Python,
<code>configure --enable-optimizations</code> before you run
<code>make</code>. This sets the default make targets up to enable
Profile Guided Optimization (PGO) and may be used to auto-enable Link
Time Optimization (LTO) on some platforms. For more details, see the
sections below.</p>
<h3 id="profile-guided-optimization">Profile Guided Optimization</h3>
<p>PGO takes advantage of recent versions of the GCC or Clang compilers.
If used, either via <code>configure --enable-optimizations</code> or by
manually running <code>make profile-opt</code> regardless of configure
flags, the optimized build process will perform the following steps:</p>
<p>The entire Python directory is cleaned of temporary files that may
have resulted from a previous compilation.</p>
<p>An instrumented version of the interpreter is built, using suitable
compiler flags for each flavor. Note that this is just an intermediary
step. The binary resulting from this step is not good for real-life
workloads as it has profiling instructions embedded inside.</p>
<p>After the instrumented interpreter is built, the Makefile will run a
training workload. This is necessary in order to profile the
interpreter's execution. Note also that any output, both stdout and
stderr, that may appear at this step is suppressed.</p>
<p>The final step is to build the actual interpreter, using the
information collected from the instrumented one. The end result will be
a Python binary that is optimized; suitable for distribution or
production installation.</p>
<h3 id="link-time-optimization">Link Time Optimization</h3>
<p>Enabled via configure's <code>--with-lto</code> flag. LTO takes
advantage of the ability of recent compiler toolchains to optimize
across the otherwise arbitrary <code>.o</code> file boundary when
building final executables or shared libraries for additional
performance gains.</p>
<h2 id="whats-new">What's New</h2>
<p>We have a comprehensive overview of the changes in the <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/whatsnew/3.10.html">What's New in
Python 3.10</a> document. For a more detailed change log, read <a
href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Misc/NEWS.d">Misc/NEWS</a>,
but a full accounting of changes can only be gleaned from the <a
href="https://github.com/python/cpython/commits/master">commit
history</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to install multiple versions of Python, see the section
below entitled "Installing multiple versions".</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/">Documentation for Python
3.10</a> is online, updated daily.</p>
<p>It can also be downloaded in many formats for faster access. The
documentation is downloadable in HTML, PDF, and reStructuredText
formats; the latter version is primarily for documentation authors,
translators, and people with special formatting requirements.</p>
<p>For information about building Python's documentation, refer to <a
href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Doc/README.rst">Doc/README.rst</a>.</p>
<h2 id="converting-from-python-2.x-to-3.x">Converting From Python 2.x to
3.x</h2>
<p>Significant backward incompatible changes were made for the release
of Python 3.0, which may cause programs written for Python 2 to fail
when run with Python 3. For more information about porting your code
from Python 2 to Python 3, see the <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html">Porting
HOWTO</a>.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>To test the interpreter, type <code>make test</code> in the top-level
directory. The test set produces some output. You can generally ignore
the messages about skipped tests due to optional features which can't be
imported. If a message is printed about a failed test or a traceback or
core dump is produced, something is wrong.</p>
<p>By default, tests are prevented from overusing resources like disk
space and memory. To enable these tests, run
<code>make testall</code>.</p>
<p>If any tests fail, you can re-run the failing test(s) in verbose
mode. For example, if <code>test_os</code> and <code>test_gdb</code>
failed, you can run:</p>
<pre><code>make test TESTOPTS=&quot;-v test_os test_gdb&quot;</code></pre>
<p>If the failure persists and appears to be a problem with Python
rather than your environment, you can <a
href="https://bugs.python.org">file a bug report</a> and include
relevant output from that command to show the issue.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://devguide.python.org/runtests/">Running &amp;
Writing Tests</a> for more on running tests.</p>
<h2 id="installing-multiple-versions">Installing multiple versions</h2>
<p>On Unix and Mac systems if you intend to install multiple versions of
Python using the same installation prefix (<code>--prefix</code>
argument to the configure script) you must take care that your primary
python executable is not overwritten by the installation of a different
version. All files and directories installed using
<code>make altinstall</code> contain the major and minor version and can
thus live side-by-side. <code>make install</code> also creates
<code>${prefix}/bin/python3</code> which refers to
<code>${prefix}/bin/python3.X</code>. If you intend to install multiple
versions using the same prefix you must decide which version (if any) is
your "primary" version. Install that version using
<code>make install</code>. Install all other versions using
<code>make altinstall</code>.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to install Python 2.7, 3.6, and 3.10 with
3.10 being the primary version, you would execute
<code>make install</code> in your 3.10 build directory and
<code>make altinstall</code> in the others.</p>
