<p>FastFlow ^<sup><sup><sup>^</sup></sup></sup></p>
<p>FastFlow is a multi-cores programming framework implemented as a C++ template library that offers a set of mechanisms to support low-latency and high-bandwidth data flows in a network of threads running on a cache-coherent multi-core architectures. On these architectures, one of the key performance issues concern memory fences, which are required to keep the various caches coherent. FastFlow provides the programmer with two basic mechanisms: 1. efficient point-to-pint communication channels; 2. a memory allocator.</p>
<p>Communication channels, as typical is in streaming applications, are unidirectional and asynchronous. They are implemented via fence-free FIFO queues. The memory allocator is built on top of these queues, thus taking advantage of their efficiency. On top of these basic machnisms FastFlow provides a library of explicitly parallel constructs (a.k.a. skeletons) such as pipeline and farm. The farm skeleton, exploits functional replication and abstracts the parallel filtering of successive independent items of the stream under the control of a scheduler.</p>

<p>FastFlow is currently actively supported for:</p>
<p>Linux with gcc &gt;4.8 x86_64 Windows 7, Windows 8 with MSVS 2013 x86_64 Mac OS 10.9 with gcc &gt;4.8 or clang 5.x</p>
<p>Previous Fastflow versions has been tested on:</p>
<p>Linux with gcc (&gt; 4.0.1): i386, x86_64 Mac OS (&gt;= 10.4) with gcc (&gt; 4.0.1): x86_64, PowerPC G4, PowerPC G5 Windows XP 32bit with Visual Studio 9 2008 Win32: i386, x86_64 Windows 7 64bit with Visual Studio 9 2008 Win32: x86_64 Windows 7 64bit with Visual Studio 9 2008 Win64: x86_64 Windows 7 64bit with Visual Studio 10 2010 Win32: x86_64 Windows 7 64bit with Visual Studio 10 2010 Win64: x86_64 Windows with cygwin: not yet tested Linux/PPC with gcc Linux/Arm with gcc</p>
<p>Main development platform are Linux and MacOS. Starting from version 2.0.4 FastFlow eavily uses C++11 features. It can be expected to work on any platform with a C++11 compiler.</p>
<p>Since &quot;core pattern layer&quot; does not stictly requires C++11 features, it can be expected to work also with an older C++ compiler.</p>
<p>Windows platform can be particuarly slow in debug mode due to iterator debugging and secure crt layers. Release mode appers to be not affected by the issue. See http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/ahazelden/entry/visual_studio_stl/</p>
<p>The following preprocessor directives /D_SECURE_SCL=0; /D_HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING=0 (i.e. ADD_DEFINITIONS(-D_SECURE_SCL=0 -D_HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING=0) in cmake) might ameliorate the problem. Consider however that they cannot be used if the application links libraries compiled with different options (e.g. Boost).</p>
