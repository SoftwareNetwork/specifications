<p>This is the GNU gettext package. It is interesting for authors or maintainers of other packages or programs which they want to see internationalized. As one step the handling of messages in different languages should be implemented. For this task GNU gettext provides the needed tools and library functions.</p>
<p>It is also interesting for translators, because GNU gettext provides the ‘msgmerge’ program, which prepares a message catalog before a translation update.</p>
<p>Users of GNU packages should also install GNU gettext because some other GNU packages will use the gettext program included in this package to internationalize the messages given by shell scripts.</p>
<p>The homepage of this package is at</p>
<pre><code>       https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/</code></pre>
<p>The primary FTP site for its distribution is</p>
<pre><code>       https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gettext/</code></pre>

<p>The configure script provides a non-standard option. It is also available in other packages that use the functionality of GNU gettext. Use</p>
<pre><code>    --disable-nls</code></pre>
<p>if you absolutely don’t want to have messages handling code. You will always get the original messages (mostly English). You could consider using NLS support even when you do not need other tongues. If you do not install any messages catalogs or do not specify to use another but the C locale you will not get translations.</p>
<p>The set of languages for which catalogs should be installed can also be specified while configuring. Of course they must be available but the intersection of these two sets are computed automatically. You could once and for all define in your profile/cshrc the variable LINGUAS:</p>
<p>(Bourne Shell) LINGUAS=“de fr nl”; export LINGUAS</p>
<p>(C Shell) setenv LINGUAS “de fr nl”</p>
<p>or specify it directly while configuring</p>
<pre><code>    env LINGUAS=&quot;de fr nl&quot; ./configure</code></pre>
<p>Consult the manual for more information on language names.</p>
