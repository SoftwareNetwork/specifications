<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<h4 id="whats-the-license">What’s the license?</h4>
<p>These libraries are in the public domain. You can do anything you
want with them. You have no legal obligation to do anything else,
although I appreciate attribution.</p>
<p>They are also licensed under the MIT open source license, if you have
lawyers who are unhappy with public domain. Every source file includes
an explicit dual-license for you to choose from.</p>
<h4 id="how-do-i-use-these-libraries">How do I use these libraries?</h4>
<p>The idea behind single-header file libraries is that they’re easy to
distribute and deploy because all the code is contained in a single
file. By default, the .h files in here act as their own header files,
i.e. they declare the functions contained in the file but don’t actually
result in any code getting compiled.</p>
<p>So in addition, you should select <em>exactly one</em> C/C++ source
file that actually instantiates the code, preferably a file you’re not
editing frequently. This file should define a specific macro (this is
documented per-library) to actually enable the function definitions. For
example, to use stb_image, you should have exactly one C/C++ file that
doesn’t include stb_image.h regularly, but instead does</p>
<pre><code>#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
#include &quot;stb_image.h&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The right macro to define is pointed out right at the top of each of
these libraries.</p>
<h4
id="are-there-other-single-file-public-domainopen-source-libraries-with-minimal-dependencies-out-there"><a name="other_libs"></a>
Are there other single-file public-domain/open source libraries with
minimal dependencies out there?</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nothings/single_file_libs">Yes.</a></p>
<h4
id="if-i-wrap-an-stb-library-in-a-new-library-does-the-new-library-have-to-be-public-domainmit">If
I wrap an stb library in a new library, does the new library have to be
public domain/MIT?</h4>
<p>No, because it’s public domain you can freely relicense it to
whatever license your new library wants to be.</p>
<h4 id="whats-the-deal-with-sse-support-in-gcc-based-compilers">What’s
the deal with SSE support in GCC-based compilers?</h4>
<p>stb_image will either use SSE2 (if you compile with -msse2) or will
not use any SIMD at all, rather than trying to detect the processor at
runtime and handle it correctly. As I understand it, the approved path
in GCC for runtime-detection require you to use multiple source files,
one for each CPU configuration. Because stb_image is a header-file
library that compiles in only one source file, there’s no approved way
to build both an SSE-enabled and a non-SSE-enabled variation.</p>
<p>While we’ve tried to work around it, we’ve had multiple issues over
the years due to specific versions of gcc breaking what we’re doing, so
we’ve given up on it. See https://github.com/nothings/stb/issues/280 and
https://github.com/nothings/stb/issues/410 for examples.</p>
<h4
id="some-of-these-libraries-seem-redundant-to-existing-open-source-libraries.-are-they-better-somehow">Some
of these libraries seem redundant to existing open source libraries. Are
they better somehow?</h4>
<p>Generally they’re only better in that they’re easier to integrate,
easier to use, and easier to release (single file; good API; no
attribution requirement). They may be less featureful, slower, and/or
use more memory. If you’re already using an equivalent library, there’s
probably no good reason to switch.</p>
<h4 id="can-i-link-directly-to-the-table-of-stb-libraries">Can I link
directly to the table of stb libraries?</h4>
<p>You can use <a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb#stb_libs">this
URL</a> to link directly to that list.</p>
<h4 id="why-do-you-list-lines-of-code-its-a-terrible-metric.">Why do you
list “lines of code”? It’s a terrible metric.</h4>
<p>Just to give you some idea of the internal complexity of the library,
to help you manage your expectations, or to let you know what you’re
getting into. While not all the libraries are written in the same style,
they’re certainly similar styles, and so comparisons between the
libraries are probably still meaningful.</p>
<p>Note though that the lines do include both the implementation, the
part that corresponds to a header file, and the documentation.</p>
<h4 id="why-single-file-headers">Why single-file headers?</h4>
<p>Windows doesn’t have standard directories where libraries live. That
makes deploying libraries in Windows a lot more painful than open source
developers on Unix-derivates generally realize. (It also makes library
dependencies a lot worse in Windows.)</p>
<p>There’s also a common problem in Windows where a library was built
against a different version of the runtime library, which causes link
conflicts and confusion. Shipping the libs as headers means you normally
just compile them straight into your project without making libraries,
thus sidestepping that problem.</p>
<p>Making them a single file makes it very easy to just drop them into a
project that needs them. (Of course you can still put them in a proper
shared library tree if you want.)</p>
<p>Why not two files, one a header and one an implementation? The
difference between 10 files and 9 files is not a big deal, but the
difference between 2 files and 1 file is a big deal. You don’t need to
zip or tar the files up, you don’t have to remember to attach
<em>two</em> files, etc.</p>
<h4 id="why-stb-is-this-something-to-do-with-set-top-boxes">Why “stb”?
Is this something to do with Set-Top Boxes?</h4>
<p>No, they are just the initials for my name, Sean T. Barrett. This was
not chosen out of egomania, but as a moderately sane way of namespacing
the filenames and source function names.</p>
<h4 id="will-you-add-more-image-types-to-stb_image.h">Will you add more
image types to stb_image.h?</h4>
<p>No. As stb_image use has grown, it has become more important for us
to focus on security of the codebase. Adding new image formats increases
the amount of code we need to secure, so it is no longer worth adding
new formats.</p>
<h4
id="do-you-have-any-advice-on-how-to-create-my-own-single-file-library">Do
you have any advice on how to create my own single-file library?</h4>
<p>Yes.
https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/docs/stb_howto.txt</p>
<h4 id="why-public-domain">Why public domain?</h4>
<p>I prefer it over GPL, LGPL, BSD, zlib, etc. for many reasons. Some of
them are listed here:
https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/docs/why_public_domain.md</p>
<h4 id="why-c">Why C?</h4>
<p>Primarily, because I use C, not C++. But it does also make it easier
for other people to use them from other languages.</p>
<h4 id="why-not-c99-stdint.h-declare-anywhere-etc.">Why not C99?
stdint.h, declare-anywhere, etc.</h4>
<p>I still use MSVC 6 (1998) as my IDE because it has better human
factors for me than later versions of MSVC.</p>
