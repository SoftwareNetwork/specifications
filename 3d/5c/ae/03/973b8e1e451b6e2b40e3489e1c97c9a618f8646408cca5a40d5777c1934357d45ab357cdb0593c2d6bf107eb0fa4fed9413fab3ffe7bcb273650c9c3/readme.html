<p>This is GNU grep, the &quot;fastest grep in the west&quot; (we hope). All bugs reported in previous releases have been fixed. Many exciting new bugs have probably been introduced in this revision.</p>
<p>GNU grep is provided &quot;as is&quot; with no warranty. The exact terms under which you may use and (re)distribute this program are detailed in the GNU General Public License, in the file COPYING.</p>
<p>GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to look at every character. The result is typically many times faster than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing back-references will run more slowly, however.)</p>

<p>KNOWN BUGS:</p>
<p>Several tests in fmbtest.sh and foad1.sh fail under the cs_CZ.UTF-8 locale and have been disabled.</p>
<p>The combination of -o and -i options is broken and the known failing cases are disabled in foad1.sh</p>
<p>The option -i does not work properly in some multibyte locales such as tr_TR.UTF-8 where the upper case and lower case forms of a character are not necessarily of the same byte length.</p>
