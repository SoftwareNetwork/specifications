<p>GNU <code>m4' is an implementation of the traditional Unix macro processor.  It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters to macros).</code>m4' also has built-in functions for including files, running shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc. Autoconf needs GNU <code>m4' for generating</code>configure' scripts, but not for running them.</p>
<p>GNU `m4' was originally written by Rene' Seindal, from Denmark. This release is considered stable.</p>
<p>If GNU <code>m4' is meant to serve GNU</code>autoconf', beware that <code>m4' should be fully installed *prior to* configuring</code>autoconf' itself. Likewise, if you intend on hacking GNU <code>m4' from git, the bootstrap process requires that you first install a released copy of GNU</code>m4'.</p>
<p>If you are just trying to build <code>m4' from a released tarball, you should not normally need to run</code>./bootstrap' or <code>autoreconf'; just go ahead and start with</code>./configure'. If you are trying to build `m4' from git, more information can be found in the version-control-only file HACKING.</p>
<p>M4 has an optional dependency on the libsigsegv library: http://www.gnu.org/software/libsigsegv/ If the library has not been installed in the standard location, you can use <code>./configure --with-libsigsegv-prefix=/path/to/dir', to make the build of</code>m4' use /path/to/dir/include/sigsegv.h as appropriate. The use of this library is optional; the only difference in having it available is that it increases the number of platforms where `m4' can correctly distinguish stack overflow from an internal bug. It is recommended that you use version 2.9 or newer.</p>
<p>In the subdirectory `examples' you will find various m4 files, ranging from trivial test files to rather advanced macros. If you intend to use m4 seriously, you might find useful material down there.</p>
<p>See file <code>BACKLOG' for a summary of pending mail and articles. See file</code>COPYING' for copying conditions. Note that M4 is distributed under the GNU Public License version 3 or later. Some files in the distribution are copied from the gnulib project, and hence bear the designation version 2 or later because they are unmodified from gnulib; however, if you modify these files using M4 rather than gnulib as the source, you must update the license to be GPLv3 or later. See file <code>INSTALL' for compilation and installation instructions. See file</code>NEWS' for a list of major changes in the current release. See file `THANKS' for a list of contributors.</p>
<p>By default, the <code>syscmd' and</code>esyscmd' macros try to use the first instance of <code>sh' found by</code>command -p getconf PATH' at configure time, with a default of <code>/bin/sh'.  If that default is inappropriate, you can use</code>./configure --with-syscmd-shell=location' to specify the shell to use.</p>
<p>By using <code>./configure --enable-changeword', you get an experimental feature which allows for changing the syntax of what is a &quot;word&quot; in</code>m4'. This feature will not be present in m4 2.0, but will be replaced by other new features which provide similar capability, so do not count on it.</p>
<p>Send bug reports to `bug-m4@gnu.org'. A bug report is an adequate description of the problem: your input, what you expected, what you got, and why this is wrong. Diffs are welcome, but they only describe a solution, from which the problem might be uneasy to infer.</p>
