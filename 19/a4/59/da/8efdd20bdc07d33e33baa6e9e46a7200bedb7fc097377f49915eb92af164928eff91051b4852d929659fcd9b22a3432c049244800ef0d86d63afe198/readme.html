<h2 id="apache-portable-runtime-library-apr">Apache Portable Runtime Library (APR)</h2>
<p>The Apache Portable Runtime Library provides a predictable and consistent interface to underlying platform-specific implementations, with an API to which software developers may code and be assured of predictable if not identical behavior regardless of the platform on which their software is built, relieving them of the need to code special-case conditions to work around or take advantage of platform-specific deficiencies or features.</p>
<p>APR and its companion libraries are implemented entirely in C and provide a common programming interface across a wide variety of operating system platforms without sacrificing performance. Currently supported platforms include:</p>
<pre><code> UNIX variants
 Windows
 Netware
 Mac OS X
 OS/2</code></pre>
<p>To give a brief overview, the primary core subsystems of APR 1.3 include the following:</p>
<pre><code> Atomic operations
 Dynamic Shared Object loading
 File I/O
 Locks (mutexes, condition variables, etc)
 Memory management (high performance allocators)
 Memory-mapped files
 Multicast Sockets
 Network I/O
 Shared memory
 Thread and Process management
 Various data structures (tables, hashes, priority queues, etc)</code></pre>
<p>For a more complete list, please refer to the following URLs:</p>
<pre><code> http://apr.apache.org/docs/apr/modules.html</code></pre>
<p>Users of APR 0.9 should be aware that migrating to the APR 1.x programming interfaces may require some adjustments; APR 1.x is neither source nor binary compatible with earlier APR 0.9 releases. Users of APR 1.x can expect consistent interfaces and binary backwards compatibility throughout the entire APR 1.x release cycle, as defined in our versioning rules:</p>
<pre><code> http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html</code></pre>
<p>APR is already used extensively by the Apache HTTP Server version 2 and the Subversion revision control system, to name but a few. We list all known projects using APR at http://apr.apache.org/projects.html -- so please let us know if you find our libraries useful in your own projects!</p>
<h1 id="using-a-subversion-checkout-on-unix">Using a Subversion Checkout on Unix</h1>
<p>If you are building APR from SVN, you need to perform a prerequisite step. You must have autoconf, libtool and python installed for this to work. The prerequisite is simply;</p>
<p>./buildconf</p>
<p>If you are building APR from a distribution tarball, buildconf is already run for you, and you do not need autoconf, libtool or python installed or to run buildconf unless you have patched APR's buildconf inputs (such as configure.in, build.conf, virtually any file within the build/ tree, or you add or remove source files).</p>
<p>Remember when updating from svn that you must rerun ./buildconf again to effect any changes made to the build schema in your fresh update.</p>
<h1 id="configuring-and-building-apr-on-unix">Configuring and Building APR on Unix</h1>
<p>Simply;</p>
<p>./configure --prefix=/desired/path/of/apr make make test make install</p>
<p>Configure has additional options, ./configure --help will offer you those choices. You may also add CC=compiler CFLAGS=&quot;compiler flags&quot; etc. prior to the ./configure statement (on the same line). Please be warned, some flags must be passed as part of the CC command, itself, in order for autoconf to make the right determinations. Eg.;</p>
<p>CC=&quot;gcc -m64&quot; ./configure --prefix=/desired/path/of/apr</p>
<p>will inform APR that you are compiling to a 64 bit CPU, and autoconf must consider that when setting up all of APR's internal and external type declarations.</p>
<p>For more verbose output from testall, you may wish to invoke testall with the flag;</p>
<p>cd test ./testall -v</p>
<h1 id="building-apr-rpm-files-on-linux">Building APR RPM files on Linux</h1>
<p>Run the following to create SRPMs:</p>
<p>rpmbuild -ts apr-<version>.tar.bz2 rpmbuild -ts apr-util-<version>.tar.bz2</p>
<p>Run the following to create RPMs (or build from the SRPMs):</p>
<p>rpmbuild -tb apr-<version>.tar.bz2 rpmbuild -tb apr-util-<version>.tar.bz2</p>
<p>Resolve dependencies as appropriate.</p>
<h1 id="configuring-and-building-apr-on-windows">Configuring and Building APR on Windows</h1>
<p>Using Visual Studio, you can build and run the test validation of APR. The Makefile.win make file has a bunch of documentation about it's options, but a trivial build is simply;</p>
<p>nmake -f Makefile.win nmake -f Makefile.win PREFIX=c:install</p>
<p>Note you must manually modify the include.hw file before you build to change default options, see the #define APR_HAS_... or the #define APR_HAVE_... statements. Be careful, many of these aren't appropriate to be modified. The most common change is</p>
<h1 id="define-apr_have_ipv6-1">define APR_HAVE_IPV6 1</h1>
<p>rather than 0 if this build of APR will be used strictly on machines with the IPv6 adapter support installed.</p>
<p>It's trivial to include the apr.dsp (for a static library) or the libapr.dsp (for a dynamic library) in your own build project, or you can load apr.dsw in Visual Studio 2002 (.NET) or later, which will convert these for you into apr.sln and associated .vcproj files.</p>
<p>When using APR as a dynamic library, nothing special is required, simply link to libapr.lib. To use it as a static library, simply define APR_DECLARE_STATIC before you include any apr header files in your source, and link to apr.lib instead.</p>
<h1 id="generating-test-coverage-information-with-gcc">Generating Test Coverage information with gcc</h1>
<p>If you want to generate test coverage data, use the following steps:</p>
<p>./buildconf CFLAGS=&quot;-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage&quot; ./configure make cd test make ./testall cd .. make gcov</p>
