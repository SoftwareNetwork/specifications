<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Protocol Buffers (a.k.a., protobuf) are Google’s language-neutral,
platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data.
You can learn more about it in <a href="https://protobuf.dev">protobuf’s
documentation</a>.</p>
<p>This README file contains protobuf installation instructions. To
install protobuf, you need to install the protocol compiler (used to
compile .proto files) and the protobuf runtime for your chosen
programming language.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-protobuf-source-code">Working With Protobuf Source
Code</h2>
<p>Most users will find working from <a
href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases">supported
releases</a> to be the easiest path.</p>
<p>If you choose to work from the head revision of the main branch your
build will occasionally be broken by source-incompatible changes and
insufficiently-tested (and therefore broken) behavior.</p>
<p>If you are using C++ or otherwise need to build protobuf from source
as a part of your project, you should pin to a release commit on a
release branch.</p>
<p>This is because even release branches can experience some instability
in between release commits.</p>
<h2 id="protobuf-compiler-installation">Protobuf Compiler
Installation</h2>
<p>The protobuf compiler is written in C++. If you are using C++, please
follow the <a href="src/README.md">C++ Installation Instructions</a> to
install protoc along with the C++ runtime.</p>
<p>For non-C++ users, the simplest way to install the protocol compiler
is to download a pre-built binary from our <a
href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases">GitHub
release page</a>.</p>
<p>In the downloads section of each release, you can find pre-built
binaries in zip packages: <code>protoc-$VERSION-$PLATFORM.zip</code>. It
contains the protoc binary as well as a set of standard
<code>.proto</code> files distributed along with protobuf.</p>
<p>If you are looking for an old version that is not available in the
release page, check out the <a
href="https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/protobuf/protoc/">Maven
repository</a>.</p>
<p>These pre-built binaries are only provided for released versions. If
you want to use the github main version at HEAD, or you need to modify
protobuf code, or you are using C++, it’s recommended to build your own
protoc binary from source.</p>
<p>If you would like to build protoc binary from source, see the <a
href="src/README.md">C++ Installation Instructions</a>.</p>
<h2 id="protobuf-runtime-installation">Protobuf Runtime
Installation</h2>
<p>Protobuf supports several different programming languages. For each
programming language, you can find instructions in the corresponding
source directory about how to install protobuf runtime for that specific
language:</p>
