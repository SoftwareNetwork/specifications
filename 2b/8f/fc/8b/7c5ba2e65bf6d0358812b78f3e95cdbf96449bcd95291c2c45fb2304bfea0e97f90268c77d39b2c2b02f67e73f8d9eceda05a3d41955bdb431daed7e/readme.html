<p>Boost Endian library</p>
<p>The Endian library is included in Boost release 1.58.0 and later.</p>
<p>See http://boostorg.github.io/endian to browse the documentation without having to download the library or install Boost.</p>
<p>To experiment with the Endian library, various other boost libraries must be available. So you need to install Boost or clone a current version of boostorg/boost if you have not already done so.</p>
<p>Boost.Endian is a header-only library, so there is no need to run a build for it, although you may need to do a &quot;b2 headers&quot;.</p>
<p>If your clone of boost is already in place, please remember to:</p>
<p>cd boost git pull git submodule update --init git submodule update ./b2 headers</p>
<p>On Windows, &quot;./&quot; is unnecessary.</p>
