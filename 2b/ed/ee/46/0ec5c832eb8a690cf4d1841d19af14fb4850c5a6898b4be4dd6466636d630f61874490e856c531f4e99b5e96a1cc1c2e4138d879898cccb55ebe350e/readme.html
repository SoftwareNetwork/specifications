<h2 id="x-window-system-unified-protocol">X Window System Unified Protocol</h2>
<p>This package provides the headers and specification documents defining the core protocol and (many) extensions for the X Window System. The extensions are those common among servers descended from X.Org 6.7. It also includes a number of headers that aren't purely protocol related, but are depended upon by many other X Window System packages to provide common definitions and porting layer.</p>
<p>Though the protocol specifications herein are authoritative, the content of the headers is bound by compatibility constraints with older versions of the X11 suite. If you are looking for a machine-readable protocol description suitable for code generation or use in new projects, please refer to the XCB project:</p>
