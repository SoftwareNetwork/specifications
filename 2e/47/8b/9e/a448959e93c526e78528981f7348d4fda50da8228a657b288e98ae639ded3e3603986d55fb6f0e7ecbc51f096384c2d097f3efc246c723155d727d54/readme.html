<p>QVM: Generic C++ library for working with Quaternions, Vectors and Matrices</p>
<p>Official documentation: https://boostorg.github.io/qvm/</p>
<ul>
<li>Emphasis on 2, 3 and 4-dimensional operations needed in graphics, video games and simulation applications.</li>
<li>Free function templates operate on any compatible user-defined quaternion, vector or matrix type.</li>
<li>Quaternion, vector and matrix types from different libraries or subsystems can be safely mixed in the same expression.</li>
<li>Type-safe mapping between compatible lvalue types with no temporary objects; e.g. transpose remaps the elements, rather than transforming the matrix.</li>
</ul>
