<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.blosc.org/pages/blosc-in-depth/">Blosc</a> is a
high performance compressor optimized for binary data (i.e. floating
point numbers, integers and booleans, although it can handle string data
too). It has been designed to transmit data to the processor cache
faster than the traditional, non-compressed, direct memory fetch
approach via a memcpy() OS call. Blosc main goal is not just to reduce
the size of large datasets on-disk or in-memory, but also to accelerate
memory-bound computations.</p>
<p>C-Blosc2 is the new major version of <a
href="https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc">C-Blosc</a>, and is backward
compatible with both the C-Blosc1 API and its in-memory format. However,
the reverse thing is generally not true for the format; buffers
generated with C-Blosc2 are not format-compatible with C-Blosc1 (i.e.
forward compatibility is not supported). In case you want to ensure full
API compatibility with C-Blosc1 API, define the <span
class="title-ref">BLOSC1_COMPAT</span> symbol.</p>

<h2 id="blosc2-ndim-an-n-dimensional-store">Blosc2 NDim: an
N-Dimensional store</h2>
<p>One of the latest and more exciting additions in C-Blosc2 is the <a
href="https://www.blosc.org/c-blosc2/reference/b2nd.html">Blosc2 NDim
layer</a> (or b2nd for short), allowing to create <em>and</em> read
n-dimensional datasets in an extremely efficient way thanks to a n-dim
2-level partitioning, that allows to slice and dice arbitrary large and
compressed data in a more fine-grained way:</p>

<p>To wet you appetite, here it is how the <span
class="title-ref">NDArray</span> object in the <a
href="#python-wrapper">Python wrapper</a> performs on getting slices
orthogonal to the different axis of a 4-dim dataset:</p>

<h2 id="new-features-in-c-blosc2">New features in C-Blosc2</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>64-bit containers:</strong> the first-class container in
C-Blosc2 is the <span class="title-ref">super-chunk</span> or, for
brevity, <span class="title-ref">schunk</span>, that is made by smaller
chunks which are essentially C-Blosc1 32-bit containers. The super-chunk
can be backed or not by another container which is called a <span
class="title-ref">frame</span> (see later).</li>
<li><strong>NDim containers (b2nd):</strong> allow to store
n-dimensional data that can efficiently read datasets in slices that can
be n-dimensional too. To achieve this, a n-dimensional 2-level
partitioning has been implemented. This capabilities were formerly part
of <a href="https://github.com/Blosc/caterva">Caterva</a>, and now it is
included in C-Blosc2 for convenience. Caterva is now deprecated.</li>
<li><strong>More filters:</strong> besides <span
class="title-ref">shuffle</span> and <span
class="title-ref">bitshuffle</span> already present in C-Blosc1,
C-Blosc2 already implements:
<ul>
<li>`bytedelta`: calculates the difference between bytes in a block that
has been shuffled already. We have <a
href="https://www.blosc.org/posts/bytedelta-enhance-compression-toolset/">blogged
about bytedelta</a>.</li>
<li>`delta`: the stored blocks inside a chunk are diff'ed with respect
to first block in the chunk. The idea is that, in some situations, the
diff will have more zeros than the original data, leading to better
compression.</li>
<li>`trunc_prec`: it zeroes the least significant bits of the mantissa
of float32 and float64 types. When combined with the <span
class="title-ref">shuffle</span> or <span
class="title-ref">bitshuffle</span> filter, this leads to more
contiguous zeros, which are compressed better.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>A filter pipeline:</strong> the different filters can be
pipelined so that the output of one can the input for the other. A
possible example is a <span class="title-ref">delta</span> followed by
<span class="title-ref">shuffle</span>, or as described above, <span
class="title-ref">trunc_prec</span> followed by <span
class="title-ref">bitshuffle</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Prefilters:</strong> allow to apply user-defined C callbacks
<strong>prior</strong> the filter pipeline during compression. See <a
href="https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc2/blob/main/tests/test_prefilter.c">test_prefilter.c</a>
for an example of use.</li>
<li><strong>Postfilters:</strong> allow to apply user-defined C
callbacks <strong>after</strong> the filter pipeline during
decompression. The combination of prefilters and postfilters could be
interesting for supporting e.g. encryption (via prefilters) and
decryption (via postfilters). Also, a postfilter alone can be used to
produce on-the-flight computation based on existing data (or other
metadata, like e.g. coordinates). See <a
href="https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc2/blob/main/tests/test_postfilter.c">test_postfilter.c</a>
for an example of use.</li>
<li><strong>SIMD support for ARM (NEON):</strong> this allows for faster
operation on ARM architectures. Only <span
class="title-ref">shuffle</span> is supported right now, but the idea is
to implement <span class="title-ref">bitshuffle</span> for NEON too.
Thanks to Lucian Marc.</li>
<li><strong>SIMD support for PowerPC (ALTIVEC):</strong> this allows for
faster operation on PowerPC architectures. Both <span
class="title-ref">shuffle</span> and <span
class="title-ref">bitshuffle</span> are supported; however, this has
been done via a transparent mapping from SSE2 into ALTIVEC emulation in
GCC 8, so performance could be better (but still, it is already a nice
improvement over native C code; see PR <a
href="https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc2/pull/59">https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc2/pull/59</a>
for details). Thanks to Jerome Kieffer and <a
href="https://www.esrf.fr">ESRF</a> for sponsoring the Blosc team in
helping him in this task.</li>
<li><strong>Dictionaries:</strong> when a block is going to be
compressed, C-Blosc2 can use a previously made dictionary (stored in the
header of the super-chunk) for compressing all the blocks that are part
of the chunks. This usually improves the compression ratio, as well as
the decompression speed, at the expense of a (small) overhead in
compression speed. Currently, it is only supported in the <span
class="title-ref">zstd</span> codec, but would be nice to extend it to
<span class="title-ref">lz4</span> and <span
class="title-ref">blosclz</span> at least.</li>
<li><strong>Contiguous frames:</strong> allow to store super-chunks
contiguously, either on-disk or in-memory. When a super-chunk is backed
by a frame, instead of storing all the chunks sparsely in-memory, they
are serialized inside the frame container. The frame can be stored
on-disk too, meaning that persistence of super-chunks is supported.</li>
<li><strong>Sparse frames:</strong> each chunk in a super-chunk is
stored in a separate file or different memory area, as well as the
metadata. This is allows for more efficient updates/deletes than in
contiguous frames (i.e. avoiding 'holes' in monolithic files). The
drawback is that it consumes more inodes when on-disk. Thanks to Marta
Iborra for this contribution.</li>
<li><strong>Partial chunk reads:</strong> there is support for reading
just part of chunks, so avoiding to read the whole thing and then
discard the unnecessary data.</li>
<li><strong>Parallel chunk reads:</strong> when several blocks of a
chunk are to be read, this is done in parallel by the decompressing
machinery. That means that every thread is responsible to read,
post-filter and decompress a block by itself, leading to an efficient
overlap of I/O and CPU usage that optimizes reads to a maximum.</li>
<li><strong>Meta-layers:</strong> optionally, the user can add meta-data
for different uses and in different layers. For example, one may think
on providing a meta-layer for <a href="https://numpy.org">NumPy</a> so
that most of the meta-data for it is stored in a meta-layer; then, one
can place another meta-layer on top of the latter for adding more
high-level info if desired (e.g. geo-spatial, meteorological...).</li>
<li><strong>Variable length meta-layers:</strong> the user may want to
add variable-length meta information that can be potentially very large
(up to 2 GB). The regular meta-layer described above is very quick to
read, but meant to store fixed-length and relatively small meta
information. Variable length metalayers are stored in the trailer of a
frame, whereas regular meta-layers are in the header.</li>
<li><strong>Efficient support for special values:</strong> large
sequences of repeated values can be represented with an efficient,
simple and fast run-length representation, without the need to use
regular codecs. With that, chunks or super-chunks with values that are
the same (zeros, NaNs or any value in general) can be built in constant
time, regardless of the size. This can be useful in situations where a
lot of zeros (or NaNs) need to be stored (e.g. sparse matrices).</li>
<li><strong>Nice markup for documentation:</strong> we are currently
using a combination of Sphinx + Doxygen + Breathe for documenting the
C-API. See <a
href="https://www.blosc.org/c-blosc2/c-blosc2.html">https://www.blosc.org/c-blosc2/c-blosc2.html</a>.
Thanks to Alberto Sabater and Aleix Alcacer for contributing the support
for this.</li>
<li><strong>Plugin capabilities for filters and codecs:</strong> we have
a plugin register capability inplace so that the info about the new
filters and codecs can be persisted and transmitted to different
machines. See <a
href="https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc2/blob/main/examples/urfilters.c">https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc2/blob/main/examples/urfilters.c</a>
for a self-contained example. Thanks to the NumFOCUS foundation for
providing a grant for doing this, and Oscar Griñón and Aleix Alcacer for
the implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Pluggable tuning capabilities:</strong> this will allow
users with different needs to define an interface so as to better tune
different parameters like the codec, the compression level, the filters
to use, the blocksize or the shuffle size. Thanks to ironArray for
sponsoring us in doing this.</li>
<li><strong>Support for I/O plugins:</strong> so that users can extend
the I/O capabilities beyond the current filesystem support. Things like
the use of databases or S3 interfaces should be possible by implementing
these interfaces. Thanks to ironArray for sponsoring us in doing
this.</li>
<li><strong>Python wrapper:</strong> we have a preliminary wrapper in
the works. You can have a look at our ongoing efforts in the <a
href="https://github.com/Blosc/python-blosc2">python-blosc2 repo</a>.
Thanks to the Python Software Foundation for providing a grant for doing
this.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> we are actively using using the <a
href="https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz">OSS-Fuzz</a> and <a
href="https://oss-fuzz.com">ClusterFuzz</a> for uncovering programming
errors in C-Blosc2. Thanks to Google for sponsoring us in doing this,
and to Nathan Moinvaziri for most of the work here.</li>
</ul>
<p>More info about the <a
href="https://www.blosc.org/docs/Caterva-HDF5-Workshop.pdf">improved
capabilities of C-Blosc2 can be found in this talk</a>.</p>
<p>C-Blosc2 API and format have been frozen, and that means that there
is guarantee that your programs will continue to work with future
versions of the library, and that next releases will be able to read
from persistent storage generated from previous releases (as of
2.0.0).</p>
<h2 id="python-wrapper">Python wrapper</h2>
<p>We are officially supporting (thanks to the Python Software
Foundation) a <a href="https://github.com/Blosc/python-blosc2">Python
wrapper for Blosc2</a>. It supports all the features of the predecessor
<a href="https://github.com/Blosc/python-blosc">python-blosc</a> package
plus most of the bells and whistles of C-Blosc2, like 64-bit and
multidimensional containers. As a bonus, the <span
class="title-ref">python-blosc2</span> package comes with wheels and
binary versions of the C-Blosc2 libraries, so anyone, even non-Python
users can install C-Blosc2 binaries easily with:</p>
<pre class="console"><code>pip install blosc2</code></pre>
<h2 id="compiling-the-c-blosc2-library-with-cmake">Compiling the
C-Blosc2 library with CMake</h2>
<p>Blosc can be built, tested and installed using <a
href="https://cmake.org">CMake</a>. The following procedure describes a
typical CMake build.</p>
<p>Create the build directory inside the sources and move into it:</p>
<pre class="console"><code>git clone https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc2
cd c-blosc2
mkdir build
cd build</code></pre>
<p>Now run CMake configuration and optionally specify the installation
directory (e.g. '/usr' or '/usr/local'):</p>
<pre class="console"><code>cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=your_install_prefix_directory ..</code></pre>
<p>CMake allows to configure Blosc in many different ways, like
preferring internal or external sources for compressors or
enabling/disabling them. Please note that configuration can also be
performed using UI tools provided by CMake (<span
class="title-ref">ccmake</span> or <span
class="title-ref">cmake-gui</span>):</p>
<pre class="console"><code>ccmake ..      # run a curses-based interface
cmake-gui ..   # run a graphical interface</code></pre>
<p>Build, test and install Blosc:</p>
<pre class="console"><code>cmake --build .
ctest
cmake --build . --target install</code></pre>
<p>The static and dynamic version of the Blosc library, together with
header files, will be installed into the specified
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.</p>
<p>Once you have compiled your Blosc library, you can easily link your
apps with it as shown in the <a
href="https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc2/blob/main/examples">examples/
directory</a>.</p>
<h3 id="handling-support-for-codecs-lz4-lz4hc-zstd-zlib">Handling
support for codecs (LZ4, LZ4HC, Zstd, Zlib)</h3>
<p>C-Blosc2 comes with full sources for LZ4, LZ4HC, Zstd, and Zlib and
in general, you should not worry about not having (or CMake not finding)
the libraries in your system because by default the included sources
will be automatically compiled and included in the C-Blosc2 library.
This means that you can be confident in having a complete support for
all these codecs in all the official Blosc deployments. Of course, if
you consider this is too bloated, you can exclude support for some of
them.</p>
<p>For example, let's suppose that you want to disable support for
Zstd:</p>
<pre class="console"><code>cmake -DDEACTIVATE_ZSTD=ON ..</code></pre>
<p>Or, you may want to use a codec in an external library already in the
system:</p>
<pre class="console"><code>cmake -DPREFER_EXTERNAL_LZ4=ON ..</code></pre>
<h3 id="supported-platforms">Supported platforms</h3>
<p>C-Blosc2 is meant to support all platforms where a C99 compliant C
compiler can be found. The ones that are mostly tested are Intel (Linux,
Mac OSX and Windows), ARM (Linux, Mac), and PowerPC (Linux). More on ARM
support in <span class="title-ref">README_ARM.rst</span>.</p>
<p>For Windows, you will need at least VS2015 or higher on x86 and x64
targets (i.e. ARM is not supported on Windows).</p>
<p>For Mac OSX, make sure that you have the command line developer tools
available. You can always install them with:</p>
<pre class="console"><code>xcode-select --install</code></pre>
<p>For Mac OSX on arm64 architecture, you may want to compile it like
this:</p>
<pre class="console"><code>CC=&quot;clang -arch arm64&quot; cmake ..</code></pre>
<h3 id="display-error-messages">Display error messages</h3>
<p>By default error messages are disabled. To display them, you just
need to activate the Blosc tracing machinery by setting the
<code>BLOSC_TRACE</code> environment variable.</p>
