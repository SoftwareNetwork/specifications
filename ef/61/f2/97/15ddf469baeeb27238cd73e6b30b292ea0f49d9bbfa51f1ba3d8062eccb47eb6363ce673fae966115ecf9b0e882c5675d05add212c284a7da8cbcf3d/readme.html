<p>This library is still under heavy development and not well documented...</p>
<p>...however it works, test coverage is good, and the error messages ... informative.</p>
<p>To compile the tests and examples it requires <a href="https://github.com/taocpp/json/">taocpp/json</a> checked out next to it.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<pre><code>#! Shell-style and C/C++-style comments are supported.

// The syntax is backwards compatible with both JSON
// and JAXN, so every JSON file is a valid config file
// (as long as its top-level value is an object), but
// the top-level &#39;{&#39; and &#39;}&#39; are optional.

// JSON object members.

&quot;foo&quot;: 42   // Like in JSON.

&quot;foo&quot; = 42  // &#39;=&#39; is an alternative for &#39;:&#39;.

&#39;foo&#39; = 42  // Keys can be single-quoted, or

foo = 42    // &#39;simple&#39; keys can be written without quotes.

// As seen above, overwriting existing values is fine!

bar = &quot;first\nsecond&quot;  // A JSON string.

bar = &#39;first\nsecond&#39;  // Single-quoted alternative.

bar = &quot;&quot;&quot;first
second&quot;&quot;&quot;  // Multi-line string, no escape sequences.

bar = &#39;&#39;&#39;
first
second&#39;&#39;&#39;  // Newline directly after an opening triple quote is ignored.

# Commas are optional, not just on top-level.

commas = {
    arrays = [
    [ 1 2 3 ],
    [ 1, 2, 3 ],
    [ 1, 2, 3, ] # trailing commas are allowed
    ]
    objects = [
    { a: 1 b: 2 c: 3 },
    { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 },
    { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, }
    ]
}

// Concatenation or addition of values.

addition1 = 1 + 2 + 3
addition2 = true + false

concatenation1 = &quot;Hello, &quot; + &quot;World&quot;
concatenation2 = [ 1 2 3 ] + [ 4 5 6 ]  // Yields [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ]

// Extending existing values.

concatenation2 += [ 7 8 9 ]  // Yields [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ]

// Nulls are ignored in an addition or concatenation with other values.

null0 = null  // Yields null.
null1 = null + null  // Yields null.
null2 = null + true  // Yields true.
null3 = &quot;ciao&quot; + null  // Yields &quot;ciao&quot;.
null4 = [ 1, 2 + null ] + null + [ 3 ]  // Yields [ 1 2 3 ].

// Assignments to nested keys.

a.b.c.d = true  // Creates intermediate objects as required.

// The &#39;-&#39; in an assignment appends a new array element.

d.e.-.- = false  // Also creates the arrays as required.

# Accessing array elements by index requires them to exist.

d.e.0 = true  // Changes d.e from [ [ false ] ] to [ true ].

// References that work both forwards and backwards.

orig1 = 1
ref1 = (orig1)

ref2 = (orig2)
orig2 = 2

(temporary orig1)  // The origs are just for referencing, tag
(temporary orig2)  // them for removal from the final result.

// References can also be nested arbitrarily.

orig3.a.b.c = &quot;x&quot;
i = &quot;b&quot;
j = &quot;i&quot;
o = &quot;orig3&quot;
ref3 = ((o).a.((j)).c)  // Yields the &quot;x&quot; from orig3.a.b.c.

// When a key is &#39;complex&#39; or starts with a digit it can also be quoted in references.

&quot;1 2 3&quot;.yes = true

ref4 = (&quot;1 2 3&quot;.yes)

// References can also index array positions, or the last element.

orig5 = [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 ]

ref5.a = (orig5.3)  // Zero-based indexing yields a 13.
ref5.b = (orig5.-)  // Yields the last element, here a 15.

// Mixing some of these features together.

orig6 = { a: [ { b: [ [ 0 ] [ 1 2 3 ] [ 2 ] ] } ] }

ref6 = (orig6.a.-.b.1) + [ 4 5 6 ] // Yields [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ]

// Copying values and sections.

copy1s = { a: { b: 100, c: 200 } }  // Same as copy1s.a.b = 100 and copy1s.a.c = 200 when copy1s wasn&#39;t previously set.

copy1d = (copy copy1s.a)  // copy1d is now a DEEP COPY of copy1s.a

copy1s.a.b = 300  // Does NOT change the value of copy1d.b from 100 to 300!

// Copying can also use - to access the last array element.

copy2s = [ [ &quot;foo&quot; &quot;bar&quot; &quot;baz&quot; ] ]

copy2d1 = (copy copy2s.-.0)  // &quot;foo&quot;
copy2d2 = (copy copy2s.-.-)  // &quot;baz&quot;

// Deleting values and sections.

del1 = 1

(delete del1)  // Deletes the corresponding top-level member.

del2.a.b.c = 1

(delete del2)  // Same thing, removes del2 and everything it contains.

del3 = [ 1 2 3 4 5 ]

/* Array indices start at 0 -- TODO: Change to 1? */

(delete del3.2)  // Deletes the third element of the array.

del4 = [ 0 1 2 ] + [ 3 4 5 ]

(delete del4.4)  // Deletes the fifth element which is the 4.

del5.a.b = {
   c = 1
   d = 2
}

(delete del5.a.b.*)  // Deletes all members from the object del5.a.b.

del6.a.b = [ 1 2 3 ]

(delete del6.a.b.*)  // Deletes all members from the array del6.a.b.

del7 = [
   { a = 1, b = 2 }
   { a = 2, c = 3 }

value4 = (shell &quot;echo hallo&quot;)  // The output of the shell command as string.

value7 = (json (read &quot;tests/showcase.j&quot;))  // The contents of the file as JSON value.

value8 = (json (read (env &quot;JSONFILE&quot;)))  // Like above but uses $JSONFILE as filename.

value9 = (json (shell &#39;&#39;&#39;echo &quot;[]&quot;&#39;&#39;&#39;))  // Parses the output of the shell as JSON.

// Note that the previous example uses triple-single-quotes for a multi-line string.

// Note that (json ...) also works for cbor, jaxn, msgpack and ubjson.

value10 = (parse (read &quot;tests/showcase.c&quot;))  // Parses a single value with config syntax.

value11 = (parse (read (env &quot;CONFIGFILE&quot;)))  // Like above but uses $CONFIGFILE as filename.

value12 = (parse (shell &quot;echo true&quot;))  // Parses the outpuf of the shell as config value.

// Note that value extensions can not be part of references or vice versa, however
// value extensions and references can both be part of an addition or concatenation.
