<pre><code>           libdmtx README file (all platforms)</code></pre>
<p>This summary of the libdmtx package applies generally to all platforms. For instructions regarding your specific platform, also see the README.xxx file in this directory that matches your system (e.g., README.linux, README.osx, etc...).</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>libdmtx is a software library that enables programs to read and write Data Matrix barcodes of the modern ECC200 variety. The library runs natively on several platforms and can be accessed by multiple languages using the libdmtx language wrappers. The utility programs dmtxread and dmtxwrite also provide a command line interface for libdmtx, and serve as a good reference for developers writing their own libdmtx-enabled programs.</p>
<p>This package (libdmtx) contains only the core library, and is distributed under a Simplified BSD license with an alternate waiver option. See the LICENSE file in the main project directory for full terms of use and distribution.</p>
<p>The non-library components related to libdmtx are available as separate downloads, and are distributed under a different license (typically LGPLv2). Please contact support@dragonflylogic.com if you require clarification on licensing. It's not complicated, but it's important to us that all license terms are respected (not just ours).</p>

<h2 id="installation">3. Installation</h2>
<p>libdmtx uses GNU Autotools so installation should be familiar to free software veterans. If your platform cannot easily run the Autotools scripts, refer to the appropriate platform-specific README.xxx located in this directory for alternate instructions.</p>
<p>In theory the following 3 steps would build and install libdmtx on your system:</p>
<p>$ ./configure $ make $ sudo make install</p>
<p>However, you may need to install additional software or make other changes for these steps to work properly. The details below will help to address errors and/or customize beyond the defaults.</p>
<h2 id="problems-with-configure-step">Problems with &quot;configure&quot; step</h2>
<p>If you obtained libdmtx from Git you may have received an error like &quot;./configure: No such file or directory&quot;. Run this command before trying again:</p>
<p>$ ./autogen.sh</p>
<p>The autogen.sh command requires autoconf, automake, libtool, and pkgconfig to be installed on your system.</p>
<p>The configure script also offers many options for customizing the build process, described in detail by running:</p>
<p>$ ./configure --help</p>
<h2 id="problems-with-make-step">Problems with &quot;make&quot; step</h2>
<p>Errors encountered during the &quot;make&quot; step are often a result of missing software dependencies. Install any missing software mentioned in the error message(s) and try again.</p>
<h2 id="problems-with-sudo-make-install-step">Problems with &quot;sudo make install&quot; step</h2>
<p>If the 'sudo' command is not configured on your system, you can alternatively yell &quot;Yeeehaww!&quot; as you log in as root and run it like this:</p>
<p># make install</p>
<h2 id="and-finally...">And finally...</h2>
<p>If you want to verify that everything is working properly you can optionally build the test programs:</p>
<p>$ make check</p>
<p>This command will not perform any tests, but will build the programs that contain test logic: multi_test, rotate_test, simple_test, and unit_test.</p>
<p>Note: multi_test and rotate_test contain extra dependencies due to their graphical nature, and are not terribly useful unless you need to test the library's internals.</p>
