<h2 id="implementation-characteristics">Implementation characteristics</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Efficient</em>: image data is packed binary (into 32-bit words); operations on 32-bit data whenever possible</li>
<li><em>Simple</em>: small number of data structures; simplest implementations provided that are efficient</li>
<li><em>Consistent</em>: data allocated on the heap with simple ownership rules; function names usually begin with primary data structure (e.g., <em>pix</em>); simple code patterns throughout</li>
<li><em>Robust</em>: all ptr args checked; extensive use of accessors; exit not permitted</li>
<li><em>Tested</em>: thorough regression tests provided for most basic functions; valgrind tested</li>
<li><em>ANSI C</em>: automatically generated prototype header file</li>
<li><em>Portable</em>: endian-independent; builds in Linux, macOS, MinGW, Cygwin, Windows</li>
<li><em>Nearly thread-safe</em>: ref counting on some structs</li>
<li><em>Documentation</em>: large number of in-line comments; doxygen; web pages for further background</li>
<li><em>Examples</em>: many programs provided to test and show usage of approx. 2600 functions in the library</li>

<h2 id="major-contributors-to-leptonica">Major contributors to Leptonica</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tom Powers: Tom has supported Leptonica on Windows for many years. He has made many contributions to code quality and documentation, including the beautiful &quot;unofficial documentation&quot; on the web site. Without his effort, Leptonica would not run today on Windows.</li>
<li>David Bryan: David has worked for years to support Leptonica on multiple platforms. He designed many nice features in Leptonica, such as the severity-based error messaging system, and has identified and fixed countless bugs. And he has built and tested each distribution many times on cross-compilers.</li>
<li>James Le Cuirot: James has written and supported the autotools scripts on Leptonica distributions for many years, and has helped test every distribution since 1.67.</li>
<li>Jeff Breidenbach: Jeff has built every Debian distribution for Leptonica. He has also made many improvements to formatted image I/O, including tiff, png and pdf. He is a continuous advocate for simplification.</li>
<li>Egor Pugin: Egor is co-maintainer of Leptonica on GitHub. He ported everything, including all the old distributions, from Google Code when it shut down. He set Leptonica up for appveyor and travis testing, and has implemented the sw project, which simplifies building executables on Windows.</li>
<li>Jürgen Buchmüller: Jürgen wrote text converters to modify Leptonica source code so that it generates documentation using doxygen. He also wrote tiff wrappers for memory I/O.</li>
<li>Stefan Weil: Stefan has worked from the beginning to clean up the Leptonica GitHub distribution, including removing errors in the source code. He also suggested and implemented the use of Coverity Scan.</li>
<li>Zdenko Podobny: Zdenko has worked, mostly behind the scenes as a primary maintainer of tesseract, to help with leptonica builds on all platforms, and coordinate with its use in tesseract.</li>
</ul>
