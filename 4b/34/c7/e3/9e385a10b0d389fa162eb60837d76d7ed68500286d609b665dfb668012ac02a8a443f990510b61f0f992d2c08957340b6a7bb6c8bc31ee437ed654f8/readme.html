<p><a href="https://imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick®</a> is a free and <a
href="https://imagemagick.org/script/license.php">open-source</a>
software suite for displaying, converting, and editing raster image and
vector image files. It can read and write over 200 image file <a
href="https://imagemagick.org/script/formats.php">formats</a>, and can
support a wide range of image manipulation operations, such as resizing,
cropping, and color correction.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-imagemagick">What is ImageMagick?</h4>
<p>ImageMagick is written in C and is available for a wide range of
operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. It can be used
as a standalone application, or as a library that can be integrated into
other software programs.</p>
<p>The main website for ImageMagick can be found at <a
href="https://imagemagick.org/">https://imagemagick.org</a>. The source
code for this software can be accessed through the repository located at
<a
href="https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick">https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick</a>.
In addition, a legacy version of ImageMagick, version 6, is also still
maintained and can be found at <a
href="https://legacy.imagemagick.org/">https://legacy.imagemagick.org</a>.</p>
<h4 id="features-and-capabilities">Features and Capabilities</h4>
<p>One of the key features of ImageMagick is its support for scripting
and automation. This allows users to create complex image manipulation
pipelines that can be run automatically, without the need for manual
intervention. This can be especially useful for tasks that require the
processing of large numbers of images, or for tasks that need to be
performed on a regular basis.</p>
<p>In addition to its core image manipulation capabilities, ImageMagick
also includes a number of other features, such as support for animation,
color management, and image rendering. These features make it a
versatile tool for a wide range of image-related tasks, including
graphic design, scientific visualization, and digital art.</p>
<p>Overall, ImageMagick is a powerful and versatile software suite for
displaying, converting, and editing image files. Its support for
scripting and automation, along with its other features, make it a
valuable tool for a wide range of image-related tasks.</p>

<p><a href="https://imagemagick.org/Usage/">Examples of ImageMagick
Usage</a>, demonstrates how to use the software from the <a
href="https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php">command
line</a> to achieve various effects. There are also several scripts
available on the website called <a
href="http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/">Fred’s ImageMagick
Scripts</a>, which can be used to apply geometric transforms, blur and
sharpen images, remove noise, and perform other operations.
Additionally, there is a tool called <a
href="https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.NET">Magick.NET</a> that allows
users to access the functionality of ImageMagick without having to
install the software on their own systems. Finally, the website also
includes a <a href="http://im.snibgo.com/">Cookbook</a> with tips and
examples for using ImageMagick on Windows systems.</p>

<p>ImageMagick best practices <strong>strongly</strong> encourages you
to configure a <a
href="https://imagemagick.org/script/security-policy.php">security
policy</a> that suits your local environment.</p>
<p>Now that ImageMagick version 7 is released, we continue to maintain
the legacy release of ImageMagick, version 6, at
https://legacy.imagemagick.org. Learn how ImageMagick version 7 differs
from previous versions with our <a
href="https://imagemagick.org/script/porting.php">porting guide</a>.</p>
<p>Want more performance from ImageMagick? Try these options:</p>
<ul>
<li>add more memory to your system, see the <a
href="https://imagemagick.org/script/architecture.php#cache">pixel
cache</a>;</li>
<li>add more cores to your system, see <a
href="https://imagemagick.org/script/architecture.php#threads">threads
of execution support</a>;</li>
<li>reduce lock contention with the <a
href="http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/tcmalloc.html">tcmalloc</a>
memory allocation library;</li>
<li>push large images to a solid-state drive, see <a
href="https://imagemagick.org/script/architecture.php#tera-pixel">large
image support</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If these options are prohibitive, you can reduce the quality of the
image results. The default build is Q16 HDRI. If you disable <a
href="https://imagemagick.org/script/high-dynamic-range.php">HDRI</a>,
you use half the memory and instead of predominantly floating point
operations, you use the typically more efficient integer operations. The
tradeoff is reduced precision and you cannot process out of range pixel
values (e.g. negative). If you build the Q8 non-HDRI version of
ImageMagick, you again reduce the memory requirements in half– and once
again there is a tradeoff, even less precision and no out of range pixel
values. For a Q8 non-HDRI build of ImageMagick, use these configure
script options: –with-quantum-depth=8 –disable-hdri.</p>
