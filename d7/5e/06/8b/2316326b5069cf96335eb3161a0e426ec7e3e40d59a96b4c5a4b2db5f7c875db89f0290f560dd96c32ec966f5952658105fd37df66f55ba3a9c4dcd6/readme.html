<p>This package contains the GNU Bison parser generator.</p>
<ul>
<li>Installation ** Build See the file INSTALL for generic compilation and installation instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bison requires GNU m4 1.4.6 or later. See:</p>
<pre><code>  https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/m4/m4-1.4.6.tar.gz</code></pre>
<p>** Internationalization Bison supports two catalogs: one for Bison itself (i.e., for the maintainer-side parser generation), and one for the generated parsers (i.e., for the user-side parser execution). The requirements between both differ: bison needs ngettext, the generated parsers do not. To simplify the build system, neither are installed if ngettext is not supported, even if generated parsers could have been localized. See http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bison/2009-08/msg00006.html for more details.</p>
