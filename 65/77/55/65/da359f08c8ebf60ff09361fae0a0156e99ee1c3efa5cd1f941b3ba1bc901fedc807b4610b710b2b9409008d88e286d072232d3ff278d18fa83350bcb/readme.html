<h1 id="vulkan-headers">Vulkan-Headers</h1>
<p>Vulkan header files and API registry</p>
<p>This repository contains Vulkan header files, include files for C and
C++, and related scripts and tests.</p>
<p>Most of the files in this repository are sourced from, or generated
from, other repositories as described in <a
href="CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a>. Vulkan-Headers exists as a
staging area for these files, most of which are then consumed by
downstream repositories used to build SDK components such as the Vulkan
Validation Layers and Conformance Test Suite.</p>
<p>Developers normally obtain headers from the official <a
href="https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/">Vulkan-SDK</a>. They can also
use headers from, or packaged from, this repository.</p>
<p>In most cases, developers should only need the headers, not the
scripts and other material in this repository. In particular if you are
packaging the headers for inclusion in Linux distributions or similar
uses, we advise that you do not include the scripts, and direct
potential users of the scripts to their canonical sources in the <a
href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs">Vulkan Specification
repository</a>.</p>

<p>Vulkan-Headers are shipped as part of the official <a

<p><code>Vulkan-Headers</code> are also supported by both <a

<h2 id="version-tagging-scheme">Version Tagging Scheme</h2>
<p>Updates to this repository which correspond to a new Vulkan
specification release are tagged using the following format:
<code>v&lt;</code><em><code>version</code></em><code>&gt;</code> (e.g.,
<code>v1.3.266</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Marked version releases have undergone
thorough testing but do not imply the same quality level as SDK tags.
SDK tags follow the
<code>vulkan-sdk-&lt;</code><em><code>version</code></em><code>&gt;.&lt;</code><em><code>patch</code></em><code>&gt;</code>
format (e.g., <code>vulkan-sdk-1.3.266.0</code>).</p>
<p>This scheme was adopted following the <code>1.3.266</code> Vulkan
specification release.</p>
