<h1 id="xxhash---extremely-fast-hash-algorithm">xxHash - Extremely fast hash algorithm</h1>
<!-- TODO: Update. -->
<p>xxHash is an Extremely fast Hash algorithm, running at RAM speed limits. It successfully completes the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/smhasher/wiki/SMHasher">SMHasher</a> test suite which evaluates collision, dispersion and randomness qualities of hash functions. Code is highly portable, and hashes are identical on all platforms (little / big endian).</p>

<p>Note †: SMHasher's CRC32 implementation is known to be slow. Faster implementations exist.</p>
<p>Q.Score is a measure of quality of the hash function. It depends on successfully passing SMHasher test set. 10 is a perfect score. Algorithms with a score &lt; 5 are not listed on this table.</p>
<p>A more recent version, XXH64, has been created thanks to <a href="https://github.com/JCash">Mathias Westerdahl</a>, which offers superior speed and dispersion for 64-bit systems. Note however that 32-bit applications will still run faster using the 32-bit version.</p>

<p>This project also includes a command line utility, named <code>xxhsum</code>, offering similar features to <code>md5sum</code>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/t-mat">Takayuki Matsuoka</a>'s contributions.</p>
<h3 id="license">License</h3>
<p>The library files <code>xxhash.c</code> and <code>xxhash.h</code> are BSD licensed. The utility <code>xxhsum</code> is GPL licensed.</p>
<h3 id="new-hash-algorithms">New hash algorithms</h3>
<p>Starting with <code>v0.7.0</code>, the library includes a new algorithm named <code>XXH3</code>, which is able to generate 64 and 128-bit hashes.</p>
<p>The new algorithm is much faster than its predecessors for both long and small inputs, which can be observed in the following graphs:</p>

<p class="caption">XXH3, latency, random size</p>
</div>
<p>To access these new prototypes, one needs to unlock their declaration, using the build macro <code>XXH_STATIC_LINKING_ONLY</code>.</p>
<p>The algorithm is currently in development, meaning its return values might still change in future versions. However, the API is stable, and can be used in production, typically for ephemeral data (produced and consumed in same session).</p>
<p><code>XXH3</code>'s return values will be finalized upon reaching <code>v0.8.0</code>.</p>
<h3 id="build-modifiers">Build modifiers</h3>
<p>The following macros can be set at compilation time to modify libxxhash's behavior. They are all disabled by default.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>XXH_INLINE_ALL</code>: Make all functions <code>inline</code>, with implementations being directly included within <code>xxhash.h</code>. Inlining functions is beneficial for speed on small keys. It's <em>extremely effective</em> when key length is expressed as <em>a compile time constant</em>, with performance improvements being observed in the +200% range . See <a href="https://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2018/03/xxhash-for-small-keys-impressive-power.html">this article</a> for details. Note: there is no need to compile an <code>xxhash.o</code> object file in this case.</li>
<li><code>XXH_NO_INLINE_HINTS</code>: By default, xxHash uses tricks like <code>__attribute__((always_inline))</code> and <code>__forceinline</code> to try and improve performance at the cost of code size. Defining this to 1 will mark all internal functions as <code>static</code>, allowing the compiler to decide whether to inline a function or not. This is very useful when optimizing for the smallest binary size, and it is automatically defined when compiling with <code>-O0</code>, <code>-Os</code>, <code>-Oz</code>, or <code>-fno-inline</code> on GCC and Clang. This may also increase performance depending on the compiler and the architecture.</li>
<li><code>XXH_REROLL</code>: Reduces the size of the generated code by not unrolling some loops. Impact on performance may vary, depending on the platform and the algorithm.</li>
<li><code>XXH_ACCEPT_NULL_INPUT_POINTER</code>: if set to <code>1</code>, when input is a <code>NULL</code> pointer, xxHash'd result is the same as a zero-length input (instead of a dereference segfault). Adds one branch at the beginning of the hash.</li>
<li><code>XXH_FORCE_MEMORY_ACCESS</code>: The default method <code>0</code> uses a portable <code>memcpy()</code> notation. Method <code>1</code> uses a gcc-specific <code>packed</code> attribute, which can provide better performance for some targets. Method <code>2</code> forces unaligned reads, which is not standards compliant, but might sometimes be the only way to extract better read performance. Method <code>3</code> uses a byteshift operation, which is best for old compilers which don't inline <code>memcpy()</code> or big-endian systems without a byteswap instruction</li>
<li><code>XXH_CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN</code>: By default, endianess is determined at compile time. It's possible to skip auto-detection and force format to little-endian, by setting this macro to 1. Setting it to 0 forces big-endian.</li>
<li><code>XXH_PRIVATE_API</code>: same impact as <code>XXH_INLINE_ALL</code>. Name underlines that XXH_* symbols will not be exported.</li>
<li><code>XXH_NAMESPACE</code>: Prefixes all symbols with the value of <code>XXH_NAMESPACE</code>. Useful to evade symbol naming collisions, in case of multiple inclusions of xxHash's source code. Client applications can still use the regular function name, as symbols are automatically translated through <code>xxhash.h</code>.</li>
<li><code>XXH_STATIC_LINKING_ONLY</code>: gives access to the state declaration for static allocation. Incompatible with dynamic linking, due to risks of ABI changes.</li>
<li><code>XXH_NO_LONG_LONG</code>: removes support for XXH3 and XXH64 for targets without 64-bit support.</li>
<li><code>XXH_IMPORT</code>: MSVC specific: should only be defined for dynamic linking, as it prevents linkage errors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="building-xxhash---using-vcpkg">Building xxHash - Using vcpkg</h3>
<p>You can download and install xxHash using the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg">vcpkg</a> dependency manager:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
./vcpkg integrate install
./vcpkg install xxhash</code></pre>
<p>The xxHash port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg">create an issue or pull request</a> on the vcpkg repository.</p>

    (...)
    XXH64_hash_t hash = XXH64(buffer, size, seed);
