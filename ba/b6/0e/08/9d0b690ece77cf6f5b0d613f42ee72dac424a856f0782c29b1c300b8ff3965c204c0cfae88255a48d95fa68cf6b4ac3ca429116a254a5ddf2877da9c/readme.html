<h1 id="libsigc-the-typesafe-callback-framework-for-c">libsigc++ : The Typesafe Callback Framework for C++</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>libsigc++ implements a typesafe callback system for standard C++. It allows you to define signals and to connect those signals to any callback function, either global or a member function, regardless of whether it is static or virtual.</p>
<p>libsigc++ is used by gtkmm to wrap the GTK+ signal system. It does not depend on GTK+ or gtkmm.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://libsigcplusplus.github.io/libsigcplusplus/">libsigc++ web site</a></p>
<h2 id="license">License</h2>
<p>Distribution of library and components is under the LGPL as listed in the file COPYING. Examples and tests are Public Domain.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>Compatible compilers must support C++17, such as the decltype(auto) specifier (from C++14) and std::invoke().</p>
<h2 id="build">Build</h2>
<p>Whenever possible, you should use the official binary packages approved by the supplier of your operating system, such as your Linux distribution. For instance, Ubuntu Linux, Debian Linux and Fedora Linux have official libsigc++ packages.</p>
<h2 id="building-from-a-release-tarball">Building from a release tarball</h2>
<p>Building from the <a href="https://github.com/libsigcplusplus/libsigcplusplus/releases">libsigc++ release tarball</a> is easier than building from git.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="ex">./configure</span> --prefix=/usr/local
$ <span class="fu">make</span>
$ <span class="fu">make</span> install</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="building-from-git">Building from git</h2>
<p>Building from git can be difficult so you should prefer building from a release tarball unless you need to work on the libsigc++ code itself.</p>
<p>To build from git you may use either the autotools build (used by most developers) or CMake (should work too).</p>
<h3 id="building-from-git-with-autotools">Building from git with autotools</h3>
<p>You must have autotools properly installed (autoconf, automake, etc) and you will also need <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mm-common/">mm-common</a>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="ex">./autogen.sh</span> --prefix=/usr/local
$ <span class="fu">make</span>
$ <span class="fu">make</span> check</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="building-from-git-with-cmake">Building from git with CMake</h3>
<p>The CMake build is not used very often by the libsigc++ developers, but it should work, and we would welcome improvements.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="fu">mkdir</span> libsigcplusplus_build
$ <span class="bu">cd</span> libsigcplusplus_build
$ <span class="fu">cmake</span> path/to/libsigcplusplus
$ <span class="fu">make</span></code></pre></div>
