<p><a href="https://taocpp.github.io/">The Art of C++</a> / JSON is a zero-dependency C++17 header-only JSON library that provides a generic <a href="doc/Value-Class.md">Value Class</a>, uses <a href="doc/Type-Traits.md">Type Traits</a> to interoperate with C++ types, and provides an <a href="doc/Events-Interface.md">Events Interface</a> to convert from and to JSON, JAXN, CBOR, MsgPack and UBJSON, and more.</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p><em>Warning: The documentation is currently not quite keeping pace with what will hopefully be the last large pre-1.0.0 development burst.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="doc/README.md">Version 1.x</a> (requires C++17)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>

<li></li>
<li><p><a href="doc/Value-Class.md">Value Class</a></p></li>
<li>JSON data model extended with non-finite number values and binary data.</li>
<li>Construction of objects and arrays via <code>std::initializer_list</code>.</li>
<li>Conversion from and to arbitrary <em>user-defined types</em> via <a href="doc/Type-Traits.md">Type Traits</a>.</li>
<li>Built around STL containers <code>std::string</code>, <code>std::map</code> and <code>std::vector</code>.</li>
<li>No memory allocations by the Value class itself (the wrapped containers allocate normally).</li>
<li>Instance sharing for string, binary, Value, and <em>user-defined types</em> via non-owning pointers.</li>

<li>Simple, straightforward and flexible Events API.</li>
<li>Events-to-Value and Value-to-Events interfaces.</li>
<li>Parse JSON &amp; JAXN string representation to Events.</li>
<li>Stream Events to (prettified) JSON &amp; JAXN string representation.</li>
<li>Conversion from and to binary formats, currently <a href="http://cbor.io">CBOR</a>, <a href="http://ubjson.org">UBJSON</a>, <a href="http://msgpack.org">MsgPack</a>.</li>
<li>Conversion from and to <em>other</em> JSON libraries (e.g. <a href="contrib/nlohmann.cpp"><code>contrib/nlohmann.cpp</code></a>).</li>
<li>Events comparison, hashing, counting, and schema validation.</li>
<li><p>Events Transformers to manipulate Events on-the-fly.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="status">Status</h2>
<p>The library is stable as in &quot;works correctly&quot; over months of multiple real-world applications.</p>
<p>The library is not stable as in &quot;under construction&quot;; some parts of the API are under discussion and development and might change and/or be extended before version 1.0.</p>
<p>This library also serves as a real-world example application of the <a href="https://github.com/taocpp/PEGTL">Parsing Expression Grammar Template Library (PEGTL)</a>, which is used for parsing the JSON and JAXN representation formats.</p>
