<div class="admonition warning">
<p>Combining older versions of pybind11 (&lt; 2.6.0) with the brand-new Python 3.9.0 will trigger undefined behavior that typically manifests as crashes during interpreter shutdown (but could also destroy your data. <strong>You have been warned.</strong>)</p>
<p>We recommend that you wait for Python 3.9.1 slated for release in December, which will include a <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/22670">fix</a> that resolves this problem. In the meantime, please update to the latest version of pybind11 (2.6.0 or newer), which includes a temporary workaround specifically when Python 3.9.0 is detected at runtime.</p>

<p><strong>pybind11</strong> is a lightweight header-only library that exposes C++ types in Python and vice versa, mainly to create Python bindings of existing C++ code. Its goals and syntax are similar to the excellent <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/python/doc/">Boost.Python</a> library by David Abrahams: to minimize boilerplate code in traditional extension modules by inferring type information using compile-time introspection.</p>
<p>The main issue with Boost.Python—and the reason for creating such a similar project—is Boost. Boost is an enormously large and complex suite of utility libraries that works with almost every C++ compiler in existence. This compatibility has its cost: arcane template tricks and workarounds are necessary to support the oldest and buggiest of compiler specimens. Now that C++11-compatible compilers are widely available, this heavy machinery has become an excessively large and unnecessary dependency.</p>
<p>Think of this library as a tiny self-contained version of Boost.Python with everything stripped away that isn’t relevant for binding generation. Without comments, the core header files only require ~4K lines of code and depend on Python (2.7 or 3.5+, or PyPy) and the C++ standard library. This compact implementation was possible thanks to some of the new C++11 language features (specifically: tuples, lambda functions and variadic templates). Since its creation, this library has grown beyond Boost.Python in many ways, leading to dramatically simpler binding code in many common situations.</p>

<h1 id="core-features">Core features</h1>
<p>pybind11 can map the following core C++ features to Python:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions accepting and returning custom data structures per value, reference, or pointer</li>
<li>Instance methods and static methods</li>
<li>Overloaded functions</li>
<li>Instance attributes and static attributes</li>
<li>Arbitrary exception types</li>
<li>Enumerations</li>
<li>Callbacks</li>
<li>Iterators and ranges</li>
<li>Custom operators</li>
<li>Single and multiple inheritance</li>
<li>STL data structures</li>
<li>Smart pointers with reference counting like <code>std::shared_ptr</code></li>
<li>Internal references with correct reference counting</li>
<li>C++ classes with virtual (and pure virtual) methods can be extended in Python</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="goodies">Goodies</h1>
<p>In addition to the core functionality, pybind11 provides some extra goodies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python 2.7, 3.5+, and PyPy/PyPy3 7.3 are supported with an implementation-agnostic interface.</li>
<li>It is possible to bind C++11 lambda functions with captured variables. The lambda capture data is stored inside the resulting Python function object.</li>
<li>pybind11 uses C++11 move constructors and move assignment operators whenever possible to efficiently transfer custom data types.</li>
<li>It’s easy to expose the internal storage of custom data types through Pythons’ buffer protocols. This is handy e.g. for fast conversion between C++ matrix classes like Eigen and NumPy without expensive copy operations.</li>
<li>pybind11 can automatically vectorize functions so that they are transparently applied to all entries of one or more NumPy array arguments.</li>
<li>Python’s slice-based access and assignment operations can be supported with just a few lines of code.</li>
<li>Everything is contained in just a few header files; there is no need to link against any additional libraries.</li>
<li>Binaries are generally smaller by a factor of at least 2 compared to equivalent bindings generated by Boost.Python. A recent pybind11 conversion of PyRosetta, an enormous Boost.Python binding project, <a href="http://graylab.jhu.edu/RosettaCon2016/PyRosetta-4.pdf">reported</a> a binary size reduction of <strong>5.4x</strong> and compile time reduction by <strong>5.8x</strong>.</li>
<li>Function signatures are precomputed at compile time (using <code>constexpr</code>), leading to smaller binaries.</li>
<li>With little extra effort, C++ types can be pickled and unpickled similar to regular Python objects.</li>
</ul>
