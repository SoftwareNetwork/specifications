<h2 id="readme-file-for-pcre-perl-compatible-regular-expression-library">README file for PCRE (Perl-compatible regular expression library)</h2>
<p>NOTE: This set of files relates to PCRE releases that use the original API, with library names libpcre, libpcre16, and libpcre32. January 2015 saw the first release of a new API, known as PCRE2, with release numbers starting at 10.00 and library names libpcre2-8, libpcre2-16, and libpcre2-32. The old libraries (now called PCRE1) are now at end of life, and 8.45 is the final release. New projects are advised to use the new PCRE2 libraries.</p>
<p>The latest release of PCRE1 is always available in three alternative formats from:</p>

<h2 id="the-pcre-apis">The PCRE APIs</h2>
<p>PCRE is written in C, and it has its own API. There are three sets of functions, one for the 8-bit library, which processes strings of bytes, one for the 16-bit library, which processes strings of 16-bit values, and one for the 32-bit library, which processes strings of 32-bit values. The distribution also includes a set of C++ wrapper functions (see the pcrecpp man page for details), courtesy of Google Inc., which can be used to call the 8-bit PCRE library from C++. Other C++ wrappers have been created from time to time. See, for example: https://github.com/YasserAsmi/regexp, which aims to be simple and similar in style to the C API.</p>
<p>The distribution also contains a set of C wrapper functions (again, just for the 8-bit library) that are based on the POSIX regular expression API (see the pcreposix man page). These end up in the library called libpcreposix. Note that this just provides a POSIX calling interface to PCRE; the regular expressions themselves still follow Perl syntax and semantics. The POSIX API is restricted, and does not give full access to all of PCRE’s facilities.</p>
<p>The header file for the POSIX-style functions is called pcreposix.h. The official POSIX name is regex.h, but I did not want to risk possible problems with existing files of that name by distributing it that way. To use PCRE with an existing program that uses the POSIX API, pcreposix.h will have to be renamed or pointed at by a link.</p>
<p>If you are using the POSIX interface to PCRE and there is already a POSIX regex library installed on your system, as well as worrying about the regex.h header file (as mentioned above), you must also take care when linking programs to ensure that they link with PCRE’s libpcreposix library. Otherwise they may pick up the POSIX functions of the same name from the other library.</p>
<p>One way of avoiding this confusion is to compile PCRE with the addition of -Dregcomp=PCREregcomp (and similarly for the other POSIX functions) to the compiler flags (CFLAGS if you are using “configure” – see below). This has the effect of renaming the functions so that the names no longer clash. Of course, you have to do the same thing for your applications, or write them using the new names.</p>
<h2 id="documentation-for-pcre">Documentation for PCRE</h2>
<p>If you install PCRE in the normal way on a Unix-like system, you will end up with a set of man pages whose names all start with “pcre”. The one that is just called “pcre” lists all the others. In addition to these man pages, the PCRE documentation is supplied in two other forms:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There are files called doc/pcre.txt, doc/pcregrep.txt, and doc/pcretest.txt in the source distribution. The first of these is a concatenation of the text forms of all the section 3 man pages except the listing of pcredemo.c and those that summarize individual functions. The other two are the text forms of the section 1 man pages for the pcregrep and pcretest commands. These text forms are provided for ease of scanning with text editors or similar tools. They are installed in <prefix>/share/doc/pcre, where <prefix> is the installation prefix (defaulting to /usr/local).</p></li>
<li><p>A set of files containing all the documentation in HTML form, hyperlinked in various ways, and rooted in a file called index.html, is distributed in doc/html and installed in <prefix>/share/doc/pcre/html.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Users of PCRE have contributed files containing the documentation for various releases in CHM format. These can be found in the Contrib directory of the FTP site (see next section).</p>
<h2 id="contributions-by-users-of-pcre">Contributions by users of PCRE</h2>
<p>You can find contributions from PCRE users in the directory</p>
<p>ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/Contrib</p>
<p>There is a README file giving brief descriptions of what they are. Some are complete in themselves; others are pointers to URLs containing relevant files. Some of this material is likely to be well out-of-date. Several of the earlier contributions provided support for compiling PCRE on various flavours of Windows (I myself do not use Windows). Nowadays there is more Windows support in the standard distribution, so these contibutions have been archived.</p>
<p>A PCRE user maintains downloadable Windows binaries of the pcregrep and pcretest programs here:</p>

<h2 id="building-pcre-on-non-unix-like-systems">Building PCRE on non-Unix-like systems</h2>
<p>For a non-Unix-like system, please read the comments in the file NON-AUTOTOOLS-BUILD, though if your system supports the use of “configure” and “make” you may be able to build PCRE using autotools in the same way as for many Unix-like systems.</p>
<p>PCRE can also be configured using the GUI facility provided by CMake’s cmake-gui command. This creates Makefiles, solution files, etc. The file NON-AUTOTOOLS-BUILD has information about CMake.</p>
<p>PCRE has been compiled on many different operating systems. It should be straightforward to build PCRE on any system that has a Standard C compiler and library, because it uses only Standard C functions.</p>
<h2 id="building-pcre-without-using-autotools">Building PCRE without using autotools</h2>
<p>The use of autotools (in particular, libtool) is problematic in some environments, even some that are Unix or Unix-like. See the NON-AUTOTOOLS-BUILD file for ways of building PCRE without using autotools.</p>
<h2 id="building-pcre-using-autotools">Building PCRE using autotools</h2>
<p>If you are using HP’s ANSI C++ compiler (aCC), please see the special note in the section entitled “Using HP’s ANSI C++ compiler (aCC)” below.</p>
<p>The following instructions assume the use of the widely used “configure; make; make install” (autotools) process.</p>
<p>To build PCRE on system that supports autotools, first run the “configure” command from the PCRE distribution directory, with your current directory set to the directory where you want the files to be created. This command is a standard GNU “autoconf” configuration script, for which generic instructions are supplied in the file INSTALL.</p>
<p>Most commonly, people build PCRE within its own distribution directory, and in this case, on many systems, just running “./configure” is sufficient. However, the usual methods of changing standard defaults are available. For example:</p>
<p>CFLAGS=‘-O2 -Wall’ ./configure –prefix=/opt/local</p>
<p>This command specifies that the C compiler should be run with the flags ‘-O2 -Wall’ instead of the default, and that “make install” should install PCRE under /opt/local instead of the default /usr/local.</p>
<p>If you want to build in a different directory, just run “configure” with that directory as current. For example, suppose you have unpacked the PCRE source into /source/pcre/pcre-xxx, but you want to build it in /build/pcre/pcre-xxx:</p>
<p>cd /build/pcre/pcre-xxx /source/pcre/pcre-xxx/configure</p>
<p>PCRE is written in C and is normally compiled as a C library. However, it is possible to build it as a C++ library, though the provided building apparatus does not have any features to support this.</p>
<p>There are some optional features that can be included or omitted from the PCRE library. They are also documented in the pcrebuild man page.</p>
<p>. By default, both shared and static libraries are built. You can change this by adding one of these options to the “configure” command:</p>
<p>–disable-shared –disable-static</p>
<p>(See also “Shared libraries on Unix-like systems” below.)</p>
<p>. By default, only the 8-bit library is built. If you add –enable-pcre16 to the “configure” command, the 16-bit library is also built. If you add –enable-pcre32 to the “configure” command, the 32-bit library is also built. If you want only the 16-bit or 32-bit library, use –disable-pcre8 to disable building the 8-bit library.</p>
<p>. If you are building the 8-bit library and want to suppress the building of the C++ wrapper library, you can add –disable-cpp to the “configure” command. Otherwise, when “configure” is run without –disable-pcre8, it will try to find a C++ compiler and C++ header files, and if it succeeds, it will try to build the C++ wrapper.</p>
<p>. If you want to include support for just-in-time compiling, which can give large performance improvements on certain platforms, add –enable-jit to the “configure” command. This support is available only for certain hardware architectures. If you try to enable it on an unsupported architecture, there will be a compile time error.</p>
<p>. When JIT support is enabled, pcregrep automatically makes use of it, unless you add –disable-pcregrep-jit to the “configure” command.</p>
<p>. If you want to make use of the support for UTF-8 Unicode character strings in the 8-bit library, or UTF-16 Unicode character strings in the 16-bit library, or UTF-32 Unicode character strings in the 32-bit library, you must add –enable-utf to the “configure” command. Without it, the code for handling UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-8 is not included in the relevant library. Even when –enable-utf is included, the use of a UTF encoding still has to be enabled by an option at run time. When PCRE is compiled with this option, its input can only either be ASCII or UTF-8/16/32, even when running on EBCDIC platforms. It is not possible to use both –enable-utf and –enable-ebcdic at the same time.</p>
<p>. There are no separate options for enabling UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 independently because that would allow ridiculous settings such as requesting UTF-16 support while building only the 8-bit library. However, the option –enable-utf8 is retained for backwards compatibility with earlier releases that did not support 16-bit or 32-bit character strings. It is synonymous with –enable-utf. It is not possible to configure one library with UTF support and the other without in the same configuration.</p>
<p>. If, in addition to support for UTF-8/16/32 character strings, you want to include support for the , , and sequences that recognize Unicode character properties, you must add –enable-unicode-properties to the “configure” command. This adds about 30K to the size of the library (in the form of a property table); only the basic two-letter properties such as Lu are supported.</p>
<p>. You can build PCRE to recognize either CR or LF or the sequence CRLF or any of the preceding, or any of the Unicode newline sequences as indicating the end of a line. Whatever you specify at build time is the default; the caller of PCRE can change the selection at run time. The default newline indicator is a single LF character (the Unix standard). You can specify the default newline indicator by adding –enable-newline-is-cr or –enable-newline-is-lf or –enable-newline-is-crlf or –enable-newline-is-anycrlf or –enable-newline-is-any to the “configure” command, respectively.</p>
<p>If you specify –enable-newline-is-cr or –enable-newline-is-crlf, some of the standard tests will fail, because the lines in the test files end with LF. Even if the files are edited to change the line endings, there are likely to be some failures. With –enable-newline-is-anycrlf or –enable-newline-is-any, many tests should succeed, but there may be some failures.</p>
<p>. By default, the sequence in a pattern matches any Unicode line ending sequence. This is independent of the option specifying what PCRE considers to be the end of a line (see above). However, the caller of PCRE can restrict  to match only CR, LF, or CRLF. You can make this the default by adding –enable-bsr-anycrlf to the “configure” command (bsr = “backslash R”).</p>
<p>. When called via the POSIX interface, PCRE uses malloc() to get additional storage for processing capturing parentheses if there are more than 10 of them in a pattern. You can increase this threshold by setting, for example,</p>
<p>–with-posix-malloc-threshold=20</p>
<p>on the “configure” command.</p>
<p>. PCRE has a counter that limits the depth of nesting of parentheses in a pattern. This limits the amount of system stack that a pattern uses when it is compiled. The default is 250, but you can change it by setting, for example,</p>
<p>–with-parens-nest-limit=500</p>
<p>. PCRE has a counter that can be set to limit the amount of resources it uses when matching a pattern. If the limit is exceeded during a match, the match fails. The default is ten million. You can change the default by setting, for example,</p>
<p>–with-match-limit=500000</p>
<p>on the “configure” command. This is just the default; individual calls to pcre_exec() can supply their own value. There is more discussion on the pcreapi man page.</p>
<p>. There is a separate counter that limits the depth of recursive function calls during a matching process. This also has a default of ten million, which is essentially “unlimited”. You can change the default by setting, for example,</p>
<p>–with-match-limit-recursion=500000</p>
<p>Recursive function calls use up the runtime stack; running out of stack can cause programs to crash in strange ways. There is a discussion about stack sizes in the pcrestack man page.</p>
<p>. The default maximum compiled pattern size is around 64K. You can increase this by adding –with-link-size=3 to the “configure” command. In the 8-bit library, PCRE then uses three bytes instead of two for offsets to different parts of the compiled pattern. In the 16-bit library, –with-link-size=3 is the same as –with-link-size=4, which (in both libraries) uses four-byte offsets. Increasing the internal link size reduces performance. In the 32-bit library, the only supported link size is 4.</p>
<p>. You can build PCRE so that its internal match() function that is called from pcre_exec() does not call itself recursively. Instead, it uses memory blocks obtained from the heap via the special functions pcre_stack_malloc() and pcre_stack_free() to save data that would otherwise be saved on the stack. To build PCRE like this, use</p>
<p>–disable-stack-for-recursion</p>
<p>on the “configure” command. PCRE runs more slowly in this mode, but it may be necessary in environments with limited stack sizes. This applies only to the normal execution of the pcre_exec() function; if JIT support is being successfully used, it is not relevant. Equally, it does not apply to pcre_dfa_exec(), which does not use deeply nested recursion. There is a discussion about stack sizes in the pcrestack man page.</p>
<p>. For speed, PCRE uses four tables for manipulating and identifying characters whose code point values are less than 256. By default, it uses a set of tables for ASCII encoding that is part of the distribution. If you specify</p>
<p>–enable-rebuild-chartables</p>
<p>a program called dftables is compiled and run in the default C locale when you obey “make”. It builds a source file called pcre_chartables.c. If you do not specify this option, pcre_chartables.c is created as a copy of pcre_chartables.c.dist. See “Character tables” below for further information.</p>
<p>. It is possible to compile PCRE for use on systems that use EBCDIC as their character code (as opposed to ASCII/Unicode) by specifying</p>
<p>–enable-ebcdic</p>
<p>This automatically implies –enable-rebuild-chartables (see above). However, when PCRE is built this way, it always operates in EBCDIC. It cannot support both EBCDIC and UTF-8/16/32. There is a second option, –enable-ebcdic-nl25, which specifies that the code value for the EBCDIC NL character is 0x25 instead of the default 0x15.</p>
<p>. In environments where valgrind is installed, if you specify</p>
<p>–enable-valgrind</p>
<p>PCRE will use valgrind annotations to mark certain memory regions as unaddressable. This allows it to detect invalid memory accesses, and is mostly useful for debugging PCRE itself.</p>
<p>. In environments where the gcc compiler is used and lcov version 1.6 or above is installed, if you specify</p>
<p>–enable-coverage</p>
<p>the build process implements a code coverage report for the test suite. The report is generated by running “make coverage”. If ccache is installed on your system, it must be disabled when building PCRE for coverage reporting. You can do this by setting the environment variable CCACHE_DISABLE=1 before running “make” to build PCRE. There is more information about coverage reporting in the “pcrebuild” documentation.</p>
<p>. The pcregrep program currently supports only 8-bit data files, and so requires the 8-bit PCRE library. It is possible to compile pcregrep to use libz and/or libbz2, in order to read .gz and .bz2 files (respectively), by specifying one or both of</p>
<p>–enable-pcregrep-libz –enable-pcregrep-libbz2</p>
<p>Of course, the relevant libraries must be installed on your system.</p>
<p>. The default size (in bytes) of the internal buffer used by pcregrep can be set by, for example:</p>
<p>–with-pcregrep-bufsize=51200</p>
<p>The value must be a plain integer. The default is 20480.</p>
<p>. It is possible to compile pcretest so that it links with the libreadline or libedit libraries, by specifying, respectively,</p>
<p>–enable-pcretest-libreadline or –enable-pcretest-libedit</p>
<p>If this is done, when pcretest’s input is from a terminal, it reads it using the readline() function. This provides line-editing and history facilities. Note that libreadline is GPL-licenced, so if you distribute a binary of pcretest linked in this way, there may be licensing issues. These can be avoided by linking with libedit (which has a BSD licence) instead.</p>
<p>Enabling libreadline causes the -lreadline option to be added to the pcretest build. In many operating environments with a sytem-installed readline library this is sufficient. However, in some environments (e.g. if an unmodified distribution version of readline is in use), it may be necessary to specify something like LIBS=“-lncurses” as well. This is because, to quote the readline INSTALL, “Readline uses the termcap functions, but does not link with the termcap or curses library itself, allowing applications which link with readline the to choose an appropriate library.” If you get error messages about missing functions tgetstr, tgetent, tputs, tgetflag, or tgoto, this is the problem, and linking with the ncurses library should fix it.</p>
<p>The “configure” script builds the following files for the basic C library:</p>
<p>. Makefile the makefile that builds the library . config.h build-time configuration options for the library . pcre.h the public PCRE header file . pcre-config script that shows the building settings such as CFLAGS that were set for “configure” . libpcre.pc ) data for the pkg-config command . libpcre16.pc ) . libpcre32.pc ) . libpcreposix.pc ) . libtool script that builds shared and/or static libraries</p>
<p>Versions of config.h and pcre.h are distributed in the PCRE tarballs under the names config.h.generic and pcre.h.generic. These are provided for those who have to built PCRE without using “configure” or CMake. If you use “configure” or CMake, the .generic versions are not used.</p>
<p>When building the 8-bit library, if a C++ compiler is found, the following files are also built:</p>
<p>. libpcrecpp.pc data for the pkg-config command . pcrecpparg.h header file for calling PCRE via the C++ wrapper . pcre_stringpiece.h header for the C++ “stringpiece” functions</p>
<p>The “configure” script also creates config.status, which is an executable script that can be run to recreate the configuration, and config.log, which contains compiler output from tests that “configure” runs.</p>
<p>Once “configure” has run, you can run “make”. This builds the the libraries libpcre, libpcre16 and/or libpcre32, and a test program called pcretest. If you enabled JIT support with –enable-jit, a test program called pcre_jit_test is built as well.</p>
<p>If the 8-bit library is built, libpcreposix and the pcregrep command are also built, and if a C++ compiler was found on your system, and you did not disable it with –disable-cpp, “make” builds the C++ wrapper library, which is called libpcrecpp, as well as some test programs called pcrecpp_unittest, pcre_scanner_unittest, and pcre_stringpiece_unittest.</p>
<p>The command “make check” runs all the appropriate tests. Details of the PCRE tests are given below in a separate section of this document.</p>
<p>You can use “make install” to install PCRE into live directories on your system. The following are installed (file names are all relative to the <prefix> that is set when “configure” is run):</p>
<p>Commands (bin): pcretest pcregrep (if 8-bit support is enabled) pcre-config</p>
<p>Libraries (lib): libpcre16 (if 16-bit support is enabled) libpcre32 (if 32-bit support is enabled) libpcre (if 8-bit support is enabled) libpcreposix (if 8-bit support is enabled) libpcrecpp (if 8-bit and C++ support is enabled)</p>
<p>Configuration information (lib/pkgconfig): libpcre16.pc libpcre32.pc libpcre.pc libpcreposix.pc libpcrecpp.pc (if C++ support is enabled)</p>
<p>Header files (include): pcre.h pcreposix.h pcre_scanner.h ) pcre_stringpiece.h ) if C++ support is enabled pcrecpp.h ) pcrecpparg.h )</p>
<p>Man pages (share/man/man{1,3}): pcregrep.1 pcretest.1 pcre-config.1 pcre.3 pcre*.3 (lots more pages, all starting “pcre”)</p>
<p>HTML documentation (share/doc/pcre/html): index.html *.html (lots more pages, hyperlinked from index.html)</p>
<p>Text file documentation (share/doc/pcre): AUTHORS COPYING ChangeLog LICENCE NEWS README pcre.txt (a concatenation of the man(3) pages) pcretest.txt the pcretest man page pcregrep.txt the pcregrep man page pcre-config.txt the pcre-config man page</p>
<p>If you want to remove PCRE from your system, you can run “make uninstall”. This removes all the files that “make install” installed. However, it does not remove any directories, because these are often shared with other programs.</p>
<h2 id="retrieving-configuration-information">Retrieving configuration information</h2>
<p>Running “make install” installs the command pcre-config, which can be used to recall information about the PCRE configuration and installation. For example:</p>
<p>pcre-config –version</p>
<p>prints the version number, and</p>
<p>pcre-config –libs</p>
<p>outputs information about where the library is installed. This command can be included in makefiles for programs that use PCRE, saving the programmer from having to remember too many details.</p>
<p>The pkg-config command is another system for saving and retrieving information about installed libraries. Instead of separate commands for each library, a single command is used. For example:</p>
<p>pkg-config –cflags pcre</p>
<p>The data is held in *.pc files that are installed in a directory called <prefix>/lib/pkgconfig.</p>
<h2 id="shared-libraries">Shared libraries</h2>
<p>The default distribution builds PCRE as shared libraries and static libraries, as long as the operating system supports shared libraries. Shared library support relies on the “libtool” script which is built as part of the “configure” process.</p>
<p>The libtool script is used to compile and link both shared and static libraries. They are placed in a subdirectory called .libs when they are newly built. The programs pcretest and pcregrep are built to use these uninstalled libraries (by means of wrapper scripts in the case of shared libraries). When you use “make install” to install shared libraries, pcregrep and pcretest are automatically re-built to use the newly installed shared libraries before being installed themselves. However, the versions left in the build directory still use the uninstalled libraries.</p>
<p>To build PCRE using static libraries only you must use –disable-shared when configuring it. For example:</p>
<p>./configure –prefix=/usr/gnu –disable-shared</p>
<p>Then run “make” in the usual way. Similarly, you can use –disable-static to build only shared libraries.</p>
<h2 id="cross-compiling-using-autotools">Cross-compiling using autotools</h2>
<p>You can specify CC and CFLAGS in the normal way to the “configure” command, in order to cross-compile PCRE for some other host. However, you should NOT specify –enable-rebuild-chartables, because if you do, the dftables.c source file is compiled and run on the local host, in order to generate the inbuilt character tables (the pcre_chartables.c file). This will probably not work, because dftables.c needs to be compiled with the local compiler, not the cross compiler.</p>
<p>When –enable-rebuild-chartables is not specified, pcre_chartables.c is created by making a copy of pcre_chartables.c.dist, which is a default set of tables that assumes ASCII code. Cross-compiling with the default tables should not be a problem.</p>
<p>If you need to modify the character tables when cross-compiling, you should move pcre_chartables.c.dist out of the way, then compile dftables.c by hand and run it on the local host to make a new version of pcre_chartables.c.dist. Then when you cross-compile PCRE this new version of the tables will be used.</p>
<h2 id="using-hps-ansi-c-compiler-acc">Using HP’s ANSI C++ compiler (aCC)</h2>
<p>Unless C++ support is disabled by specifying the “–disable-cpp” option of the “configure” script, you must include the “-AA” option in the CXXFLAGS environment variable in order for the C++ components to compile correctly.</p>
<p>Also, note that the aCC compiler on PA-RISC platforms may have a defect whereby needed libraries fail to get included when specifying the “-AA” compiler option. If you experience unresolved symbols when linking the C++ programs, use the workaround of specifying the following environment variable prior to running the “configure” script:</p>
<p>CXXLDFLAGS=“-lstd_v2 -lCsup_v2”</p>
<h2 id="compiling-in-tru64-using-native-compilers">Compiling in Tru64 using native compilers</h2>
<p>The following error may occur when compiling with native compilers in the Tru64 operating system:</p>
<p>CXX libpcrecpp_la-pcrecpp.lo cxx: Error: /usr/lib/cmplrs/cxx/V7.1-006/include/cxx/iosfwd, line 58: #error directive: "cannot include iosfwd – define __USE_STD_IOSTREAM to override default - see section 7.1.2 of the C++ Using Guide" #error "cannot include iosfwd – define __USE_STD_IOSTREAM to override default - see section 7.1.2 of the C++ Using Guide"</p>
<p>This may be followed by other errors, complaining that ‘namespace “std” has no member’. The solution to this is to add the line</p>
<p>#define __USE_STD_IOSTREAM 1</p>
<p>to the config.h file.</p>
<h2 id="using-suns-compilers-for-solaris">Using Sun’s compilers for Solaris</h2>
<p>A user reports that the following configurations work on Solaris 9 sparcv9 and Solaris 9 x86 (32-bit):</p>
<p>Solaris 9 sparcv9: ./configure –disable-cpp CC=/bin/cc CFLAGS=“-m64 -g” Solaris 9 x86: ./configure –disable-cpp CC=/bin/cc CFLAGS=“-g”</p>
<h2 id="using-pcre-from-mysql">Using PCRE from MySQL</h2>
<p>On systems where both PCRE and MySQL are installed, it is possible to make use of PCRE from within MySQL, as an alternative to the built-in pattern matching. There is a web page that tells you how to do this:</p>
<p>http://www.mysqludf.org/lib_mysqludf_preg/index.php</p>
<h2 id="making-new-tarballs">Making new tarballs</h2>
<p>The command “make dist” creates three PCRE tarballs, in tar.gz, tar.bz2, and zip formats. The command “make distcheck” does the same, but then does a trial build of the new distribution to ensure that it works.</p>
<p>If you have modified any of the man page sources in the doc directory, you should first run the PrepareRelease script before making a distribution. This script creates the .txt and HTML forms of the documentation from the man pages.</p>
<h2 id="testing-pcre">Testing PCRE</h2>
<p>To test the basic PCRE library on a Unix-like system, run the RunTest script. There is another script called RunGrepTest that tests the options of the pcregrep command. If the C++ wrapper library is built, three test programs called pcrecpp_unittest, pcre_scanner_unittest, and pcre_stringpiece_unittest are also built. When JIT support is enabled, another test program called pcre_jit_test is built.</p>
<p>Both the scripts and all the program tests are run if you obey “make check” or “make test”. For other environments, see the instructions in NON-AUTOTOOLS-BUILD.</p>
<p>The RunTest script runs the pcretest test program (which is documented in its own man page) on each of the relevant testinput files in the testdata directory, and compares the output with the contents of the corresponding testoutput files. RunTest uses a file called testtry to hold the main output from pcretest. Other files whose names begin with “test” are used as working files in some tests.</p>
<p>Some tests are relevant only when certain build-time options were selected. For example, the tests for UTF-8/16/32 support are run only if –enable-utf was used. RunTest outputs a comment when it skips a test.</p>
<p>Many of the tests that are not skipped are run up to three times. The second run forces pcre_study() to be called for all patterns except for a few in some tests that are marked “never study” (see the pcretest program for how this is done). If JIT support is available, the non-DFA tests are run a third time, this time with a forced pcre_study() with the PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE option. This testing can be suppressed by putting “nojit” on the RunTest command line.</p>
<p>The entire set of tests is run once for each of the 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit libraries that are enabled. If you want to run just one set of tests, call RunTest with either the -8, -16 or -32 option.</p>
<p>If valgrind is installed, you can run the tests under it by putting “valgrind” on the RunTest command line. To run pcretest on just one or more specific test files, give their numbers as arguments to RunTest, for example:</p>
<p>RunTest 2 7 11</p>
<p>You can also specify ranges of tests such as 3-6 or 3- (meaning 3 to the end), or a number preceded by ~ to exclude a test. For example:</p>
<p>Runtest 3-15 ~10</p>
<p>This runs tests 3 to 15, excluding test 10, and just ~13 runs all the tests except test 13. Whatever order the arguments are in, the tests are always run in numerical order.</p>
<p>You can also call RunTest with the single argument “list” to cause it to output a list of tests.</p>
<p>The first test file can be fed directly into the perltest.pl script to check that Perl gives the same results. The only difference you should see is in the first few lines, where the Perl version is given instead of the PCRE version.</p>
<p>The second set of tests check pcre_fullinfo(), pcre_study(), pcre_copy_substring(), pcre_get_substring(), pcre_get_substring_list(), error detection, and run-time flags that are specific to PCRE, as well as the POSIX wrapper API. It also uses the debugging flags to check some of the internals of pcre_compile().</p>
<p>If you build PCRE with a locale setting that is not the standard C locale, the character tables may be different (see next paragraph). In some cases, this may cause failures in the second set of tests. For example, in a locale where the isprint() function yields TRUE for characters in the range 128-255, the use of [:isascii:] inside a character class defines a different set of characters, and this shows up in this test as a difference in the compiled code, which is being listed for checking. Where the comparison test output contains [-7f] the test will contain [-], and similarly in some other cases. This is not a bug in PCRE.</p>
<p>The third set of tests checks pcre_maketables(), the facility for building a set of character tables for a specific locale and using them instead of the default tables. The tests make use of the “fr_FR” (French) locale. Before running the test, the script checks for the presence of this locale by running the “locale” command. If that command fails, or if it doesn’t include “fr_FR” in the list of available locales, the third test cannot be run, and a comment is output to say why. If running this test produces instances of the error</p>
<p>** Failed to set locale “fr_FR”</p>
<p>in the comparison output, it means that locale is not available on your system, despite being listed by “locale”. This does not mean that PCRE is broken.</p>
<p>[If you are trying to run this test on Windows, you may be able to get it to work by changing “fr_FR” to “french” everywhere it occurs. Alternatively, use RunTest.bat. The version of RunTest.bat included with PCRE 7.4 and above uses Windows versions of test 2. More info on using RunTest.bat is included in the document entitled NON-UNIX-USE.]</p>
<p>The fourth and fifth tests check the UTF-8/16/32 support and error handling and internal UTF features of PCRE that are not relevant to Perl, respectively. The sixth and seventh tests do the same for Unicode character properties support.</p>
<p>The eighth, ninth, and tenth tests check the pcre_dfa_exec() alternative matching function, in non-UTF-8/16/32 mode, UTF-8/16/32 mode, and UTF-8/16/32 mode with Unicode property support, respectively.</p>
<p>The eleventh test checks some internal offsets and code size features; it is run only when the default “link size” of 2 is set (in other cases the sizes change) and when Unicode property support is enabled.</p>
<p>The twelfth test is run only when JIT support is available, and the thirteenth test is run only when JIT support is not available. They test some JIT-specific features such as information output from pcretest about JIT compilation.</p>
<p>The fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth tests are run only in 8-bit mode, and the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth tests are run only in 16/32-bit mode. These are tests that generate different output in the two modes. They are for general cases, UTF-8/16/32 support, and Unicode property support, respectively.</p>
<p>The twentieth test is run only in 16/32-bit mode. It tests some specific 16/32-bit features of the DFA matching engine.</p>
<p>The twenty-first and twenty-second tests are run only in 16/32-bit mode, when the link size is set to 2 for the 16-bit library. They test reloading pre-compiled patterns.</p>
<p>The twenty-third and twenty-fourth tests are run only in 16-bit mode. They are for general cases, and UTF-16 support, respectively.</p>
<p>The twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth tests are run only in 32-bit mode. They are for general cases, and UTF-32 support, respectively.</p>
<h2 id="character-tables">Character tables</h2>
<p>For speed, PCRE uses four tables for manipulating and identifying characters whose code point values are less than 256. The final argument of the pcre_compile() function is a pointer to a block of memory containing the concatenated tables. A call to pcre_maketables() can be used to generate a set of tables in the current locale. If the final argument for pcre_compile() is passed as NULL, a set of default tables that is built into the binary is used.</p>
<p>The source file called pcre_chartables.c contains the default set of tables. By default, this is created as a copy of pcre_chartables.c.dist, which contains tables for ASCII coding. However, if –enable-rebuild-chartables is specified for ./configure, a different version of pcre_chartables.c is built by the program dftables (compiled from dftables.c), which uses the ANSI C character handling functions such as isalnum(), isalpha(), isupper(), islower(), etc. to build the table sources. This means that the default C locale which is set for your system will control the contents of these default tables. You can change the default tables by editing pcre_chartables.c and then re-building PCRE. If you do this, you should take care to ensure that the file does not get automatically re-generated. The best way to do this is to move pcre_chartables.c.dist out of the way and replace it with your customized tables.</p>
<p>When the dftables program is run as a result of –enable-rebuild-chartables, it uses the default C locale that is set on your system. It does not pay attention to the LC_xxx environment variables. In other words, it uses the system’s default locale rather than whatever the compiling user happens to have set. If you really do want to build a source set of character tables in a locale that is specified by the LC_xxx variables, you can run the dftables program by hand with the -L option. For example:</p>
<p>./dftables -L pcre_chartables.c.special</p>
<p>The first two 256-byte tables provide lower casing and case flipping functions, respectively. The next table consists of three 32-byte bit maps which identify digits, “word” characters, and white space, respectively. These are used when building 32-byte bit maps that represent character classes for code points less than 256.</p>
<p>The final 256-byte table has bits indicating various character types, as follows:</p>
<pre><code>1   white space character
2   letter
4   decimal digit
8   hexadecimal digit</code></pre>
<p>16 alphanumeric or ’_’ 128 regular expression metacharacter or binary zero</p>
<p>You should not alter the set of characters that contain the 128 bit, as that will cause PCRE to malfunction.</p>
