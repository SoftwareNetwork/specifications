<h1 id="efficient-and-performance-portable-vector-software">Efficient
and performance-portable vector software</h1>
<p>Highway is a C++ library that provides portable SIMD/vector
intrinsics.</p>
<p><a
href="https://google.github.io/highway/en/master/">Documentation</a></p>
<p>Previously licensed under Apache 2, now dual-licensed as Apache 2 /
BSD-3.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>We are passionate about high-performance software. We see major
untapped potential in CPUs (servers, mobile, desktops). Highway is for
engineers who want to reliably and economically push the boundaries of
what is possible in software.</p>
<h2 id="how">How</h2>
<p>CPUs provide SIMD/vector instructions that apply the same operation
to multiple data items. This can reduce energy usage
e.g. <em>fivefold</em> because fewer instructions are executed. We also
often see <em>5-10x</em> speedups.</p>
<p>Highway makes SIMD/vector programming practical and workable
according to these guiding principles:</p>
<p><strong>Does what you expect</strong>: Highway is a C++ library with
carefully-chosen functions that map well to CPU instructions without
extensive compiler transformations. The resulting code is more
predictable and robust to code changes/compiler updates than
autovectorization.</p>
<p><strong>Works on widely-used platforms</strong>: Highway supports
five architectures; the same application code can target various
instruction sets, including those with ‘scalable’ vectors (size unknown
at compile time). Highway only requires C++11 and supports four families
of compilers. If you would like to use Highway on other platforms,
please raise an issue.</p>
<p><strong>Flexible to deploy</strong>: Applications using Highway can
run on heterogeneous clouds or client devices, choosing the best
available instruction set at runtime. Alternatively, developers may
choose to target a single instruction set without any runtime overhead.
In both cases, the application code is the same except for swapping
<code>HWY_STATIC_DISPATCH</code> with <code>HWY_DYNAMIC_DISPATCH</code>
plus one line of code.</p>
<p><strong>Suitable for a variety of domains</strong>: Highway provides
an extensive set of operations, used for image processing
(floating-point), compression, video analysis, linear algebra,
cryptography, sorting and random generation. We recognise that new
use-cases may require additional ops and are happy to add them where it
makes sense (e.g. no performance cliffs on some architectures). If you
would like to discuss, please file an issue.</p>
<p><strong>Rewards data-parallel design</strong>: Highway provides tools
such as Gather, MaskedLoad, and FixedTag to enable speedups for legacy
data structures. However, the biggest gains are unlocked by designing
algorithms and data structures for scalable vectors. Helpful techniques
include batching, structure-of-array layouts, and aligned/padded
allocations.</p>

<h2 id="current-status">Current status</h2>
<h3 id="targets">Targets</h3>
<p>Highway supports 24 targets, listed in alphabetical order of
platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any: <code>EMU128</code>, <code>SCALAR</code>;</li>
<li>Armv7+: <code>NEON_WITHOUT_AES</code>, <code>NEON</code>,
<code>NEON_BF16</code>, <code>SVE</code>, <code>SVE2</code>,
<code>SVE_256</code>, <code>SVE2_128</code>;</li>
<li>IBM Z: <code>Z14</code>, <code>Z15</code>;</li>
<li>POWER: <code>PPC8</code> (v2.07), <code>PPC9</code> (v3.0),
<code>PPC10</code> (v3.1B, not yet supported due to compiler bugs, see
#1207; also requires QEMU 7.2);</li>
<li>RISC-V: <code>RVV</code> (1.0);</li>
<li>WebAssembly: <code>WASM</code>, <code>WASM_EMU256</code> (a 2x
unrolled version of wasm128, enabled if <code>HWY_WANT_WASM2</code> is
defined. This will remain supported until it is potentially superseded
by a future version of WASM.);</li>
<li>x86:
<ul>
<li><code>SSE2</code></li>
<li><code>SSSE3</code> (~Intel Core)</li>
<li><code>SSE4</code> (~Nehalem, also includes AES + CLMUL).</li>
<li><code>AVX2</code> (~Haswell, also includes BMI2 + F16 + FMA)</li>
<li><code>AVX3</code> (~Skylake, AVX-512F/BW/CD/DQ/VL)</li>
<li><code>AVX3_DL</code> (~Icelake, includes BitAlg + CLMUL + GFNI +
VAES + VBMI + VBMI2 + VNNI + VPOPCNT; requires opt-in by defining
<code>HWY_WANT_AVX3_DL</code> unless compiling for static
dispatch),</li>
<li><code>AVX3_ZEN4</code> (like AVX3_DL but optimized for AMD Zen4;
requires opt-in by defining <code>HWY_WANT_AVX3_ZEN4</code> if compiling
for static dispatch)</li>
<li><code>AVX3_SPR</code> (~Sapphire Rapids, includes AVX-512FP16)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Our policy is that unless otherwise specified, targets will remain
supported as long as they can be (cross-)compiled with currently
supported Clang or GCC, and tested using QEMU. If the target can be
compiled with LLVM trunk and tested using our version of QEMU without
extra flags, then it is eligible for inclusion in our continuous testing
infrastructure. Otherwise, the target will be manually tested before
releases with selected versions/configurations of Clang and GCC.</p>
<p>SVE was initially tested using farm_sve (see acknowledgments).</p>
<h3 id="versioning">Versioning</h3>
<p>Highway releases aim to follow the semver.org system
(MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH), incrementing MINOR after backward-compatible
additions and PATCH after backward-compatible fixes. We recommend using
releases (rather than the Git tip) because they are tested more
extensively, see below.</p>
<p>The current version 1.0 signals an increased focus on backwards
compatibility. Applications using documented functionality will remain
compatible with future updates that have the same major version
number.</p>
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>Continuous integration tests build with a recent version of Clang
(running on native x86, or QEMU for RISC-V and Arm) and MSVC 2019
(v19.28, running on native x86).</p>
<p>Before releases, we also test on x86 with Clang and GCC, and Armv7/8
via GCC cross-compile. See the <a
href="g3doc/release_testing_process.md">testing process</a> for
details.</p>
<h3 id="related-modules">Related modules</h3>
<p>The <code>contrib</code> directory contains SIMD-related utilities:
an image class with aligned rows, a math library (16 functions already
implemented, mostly trigonometry), and functions for computing dot
products and sorting.</p>
<h3 id="other-libraries">Other libraries</h3>
<p>If you only require x86 support, you may also use Agner Fog’s <a
href="https://github.com/vectorclass">VCL vector class library</a>. It
includes many functions including a complete math library.</p>
<p>If you have existing code using x86/NEON intrinsics, you may be
interested in <a
href="https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde">SIMDe</a>, which
emulates those intrinsics using other platforms’ intrinsics or
autovectorization.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>This project uses CMake to generate and build. In a Debian-based
system you can install it via:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">sudo</span> apt install cmake</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Highway’s unit tests use <a
href="https://github.com/google/googletest">googletest</a>. By default,
Highway’s CMake downloads this dependency at configuration time. You can
avoid this by setting the <code>HWY_SYSTEM_GTEST</code> CMake variable
to ON and installing gtest separately:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">sudo</span> apt install libgtest-dev</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, you can define <code>HWY_TEST_STANDALONE=1</code> and
remove all occurrences of <code>gtest_main</code> in each BUILD file,
then tests avoid the dependency on GUnit.</p>
<p>Running cross-compiled tests requires support from the OS, which on
Debian is provided by the <code>qemu-user-binfmt</code> package.</p>
<p>To build Highway as a shared or static library (depending on
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS), the standard CMake workflow can be used:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">mkdir</span> <span class="at">-p</span> build <span class="kw">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="bu">cd</span> build</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">cmake</span> ..</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">make</span> <span class="at">-j</span> <span class="kw">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="fu">make</span> test</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or you can run <code>run_tests.sh</code> (<code>run_tests.bat</code>
on Windows).</p>
<p>Bazel is also supported for building, but it is not as widely
used/tested.</p>
<p>When building for Armv7, a limitation of current compilers requires
you to add <code>-DHWY_CMAKE_ARM7:BOOL=ON</code> to the CMake command
line; see #834 and #1032. We understand that work is underway to remove
this limitation.</p>
<p>Building on 32-bit x86 is not officially supported, and AVX2/3 are
disabled by default there. Note that johnplatts has successfully built
and run the Highway tests on 32-bit x86, including AVX2/3, on GCC 7/8
and Clang 8/11/12. On Ubuntu 22.04, Clang 11 and 12, but not later
versions, require extra compiler flags
<code>-m32 -isystem /usr/i686-linux-gnu/include</code>. Clang 10 and
earlier require the above plus
<code>-isystem /usr/i686-linux-gnu/include/c++/12/i686-linux-gnu</code>.
See #1279.</p>
<h2 id="building-highway---using-vcpkg">Building highway - Using

<p>highway is now available in <a

<h2 id="quick-start">Quick start</h2>
<p>You can use the <code>benchmark</code> inside examples/ as a starting
point.</p>
<p>A <a href="g3doc/quick_reference.md">quick-reference page</a> briefly
lists all operations and their parameters, and the <a
href="g3doc/instruction_matrix.pdf">instruction_matrix</a> indicates the
number of instructions per operation.</p>
<p>The <a href="g3doc/faq.md">FAQ</a> answers questions about
portability, API design and where to find more information.</p>
<p>We recommend using full SIMD vectors whenever possible for maximum
performance portability. To obtain them, pass a
<code>ScalableTag&lt;float&gt;</code> (or equivalently
<code>HWY_FULL(float)</code>) tag to functions such as
<code>Zero/Set/Load</code>. There are two alternatives for use-cases
requiring an upper bound on the lanes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For up to <code>N</code> lanes, specify
<code>CappedTag&lt;T, N&gt;</code> or the equivalent
<code>HWY_CAPPED(T, N)</code>. The actual number of lanes will be
<code>N</code> rounded down to the nearest power of two, such as 4 if
<code>N</code> is 5, or 8 if <code>N</code> is 8. This is useful for
data structures such as a narrow matrix. A loop is still required
because vectors may actually have fewer than <code>N</code>
lanes.</p></li>
<li><p>For exactly a power of two <code>N</code> lanes, specify
<code>FixedTag&lt;T, N&gt;</code>. The largest supported <code>N</code>
depends on the target, but is guaranteed to be at least
<code>16/sizeof(T)</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Due to ADL restrictions, user code calling Highway ops must either: *
Reside inside <code>namespace hwy { namespace HWY_NAMESPACE {</code>; or
* prefix each op with an alias such as
<code>namespace hn = hwy::HWY_NAMESPACE;     hn::Add()</code>; or * add
using-declarations for each op used:
<code>using hwy::HWY_NAMESPACE::Add;</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, each function that calls Highway ops (such as
<code>Load</code>) must either be prefixed with <code>HWY_ATTR</code>,
OR reside between <code>HWY_BEFORE_NAMESPACE()</code> and
<code>HWY_AFTER_NAMESPACE()</code>. Lambda functions currently require
<code>HWY_ATTR</code> before their opening brace.</p>
<p>Do not use namespace-scope nor <code>static</code> initializers for
SIMD vectors because this can cause SIGILL when using runtime dispatch
and the compiler chooses an initializer compiled for a target not
supported by the current CPU. Instead, constants initialized via
<code>Set</code> should generally be local (const) variables.</p>
<p>The entry points into code using Highway differ slightly depending on
whether they use static or dynamic dispatch. In both cases, we recommend
that the top-level function receives one or more pointers to arrays,
rather than target-specific vector types.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For static dispatch, <code>HWY_TARGET</code> will be the best
available target among <code>HWY_BASELINE_TARGETS</code>, i.e. those
allowed for use by the compiler (see <a
href="g3doc/quick_reference.md">quick-reference</a>). Functions inside
<code>HWY_NAMESPACE</code> can be called using
<code>HWY_STATIC_DISPATCH(func)(args)</code> within the same module they
are defined in. You can call the function from other modules by wrapping
it in a regular function and declaring the regular function in a
header.</p></li>
<li><p>For dynamic dispatch, a table of function pointers is generated
via the <code>HWY_EXPORT</code> macro that is used by
<code>HWY_DYNAMIC_DISPATCH(func)(args)</code> to call the best function
pointer for the current CPU’s supported targets. A module is
automatically compiled for each target in <code>HWY_TARGETS</code> (see
<a href="g3doc/quick_reference.md">quick-reference</a>) if
<code>HWY_TARGET_INCLUDE</code> is defined and
<code>foreach_target.h</code> is included. Note that the first
invocation of <code>HWY_DYNAMIC_DISPATCH</code>, or each call to the
pointer returned by the first invocation of
<code>HWY_DYNAMIC_POINTER</code>, involves some CPU detection overhead.
You can prevent this by calling the following before any invocation of
<code>HWY_DYNAMIC_*</code>:
<code>hwy::GetChosenTarget().Update(hwy::SupportedTargets());</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When using dynamic dispatch, <code>foreach_target.h</code> is
included from translation units (.cc files), not headers. Headers
containing vector code shared between several translation units require
a special include guard, for example the following taken from
<code>examples/skeleton-inl.h</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#if defined(HIGHWAY_HWY_EXAMPLES_SKELETON_INL_H_) == defined(HWY_TARGET_TOGGLE)
#ifdef HIGHWAY_HWY_EXAMPLES_SKELETON_INL_H_
#undef HIGHWAY_HWY_EXAMPLES_SKELETON_INL_H_
#else
#define HIGHWAY_HWY_EXAMPLES_SKELETON_INL_H_
#endif

#include &quot;hwy/highway.h&quot;
// Your vector code
#endif</code></pre>
<p>By convention, we name such headers <code>-inl.h</code> because their
contents (often function templates) are usually inlined.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-flags">Compiler flags</h2>
<p>Applications should be compiled with optimizations enabled. Without
inlining SIMD code may slow down by factors of 10 to 100. For clang and
GCC, <code>-O2</code> is generally sufficient.</p>
<p>For MSVC, we recommend compiling with <code>/Gv</code> to allow
non-inlined functions to pass vector arguments in registers. If
intending to use the AVX2 target together with half-width vectors
(e.g. for <code>PromoteTo</code>), it is also important to compile with
<code>/arch:AVX2</code>. This seems to be the only way to reliably
generate VEX-encoded SSE instructions on MSVC. Sometimes MSVC generates
VEX-encoded SSE instructions, if they are mixed with AVX, but not
always, see <a
href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/10618264">DevCom-10618264</a>.
Otherwise, mixing VEX-encoded AVX2 instructions and non-VEX SSE may
cause severe performance degradation. Unfortunately, with
<code>/arch:AVX2</code> option, the resulting binary will then require
AVX2. Note that no such flag is needed for clang and GCC because they
support target-specific attributes, which we use to ensure proper VEX
code generation for AVX2 targets.</p>
<h2 id="strip-mining-loops">Strip-mining loops</h2>
<p>When vectorizing a loop, an important question is whether and how to
deal with a number of iterations (‘trip count’, denoted
<code>count</code>) that does not evenly divide the vector size
<code>N = Lanes(d)</code>. For example, it may be necessary to avoid
writing past the end of an array.</p>
<p>In this section, let <code>T</code> denote the element type and
<code>d = ScalableTag&lt;T&gt;</code>. Assume the loop body is given as
a function
<code>template&lt;bool partial, class D&gt; void LoopBody(D d, size_t index, size_t max_n)</code>.</p>
<p>“Strip-mining” is a technique for vectorizing a loop by transforming
it into an outer loop and inner loop, such that the number of iterations
in the inner loop matches the vector width. Then, the inner loop is
replaced with vector operations.</p>
<p>Highway offers several strategies for loop vectorization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure all inputs/outputs are padded. Then the (outer) loop is
simply</p>
<pre><code>for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; count; i += N) LoopBody&lt;false&gt;(d, i, 0);</code></pre>
<p>Here, the template parameter and second function argument are not
needed.</p>
<p>This is the preferred option, unless <code>N</code> is in the
thousands and vector operations are pipelined with long latencies. This
was the case for supercomputers in the 90s, but nowadays ALUs are cheap
and we see most implementations split vectors into 1, 2 or 4 parts, so
there is little cost to processing entire vectors even if we do not need
all their lanes. Indeed this avoids the (potentially large) cost of
predication or partial loads/stores on older targets, and does not
duplicate code.</p></li>
<li><p>Process whole vectors and include previously processed elements
in the last vector:
<code>for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; count; i += N) LoopBody&lt;false&gt;(d, HWY_MIN(i, count - N), 0);</code></p>
<p>This is the second preferred option provided that
<code>count &gt;= N</code> and <code>LoopBody</code> is idempotent. Some
elements might be processed twice, but a single code path and full
vectorization is usually worth it. Even if <code>count &lt; N</code>, it
usually makes sense to pad inputs/outputs up to <code>N</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the <code>Transform*</code> functions in
hwy/contrib/algo/transform-inl.h. This takes care of the loop and
remainder handling and you simply define a generic lambda function
(C++14) or functor which receives the current vector from the
input/output array, plus optionally vectors from up to two extra input
arrays, and returns the value to write to the input/output array.</p>
<p>Here is an example implementing the BLAS function SAXPY
(<code>alpha * x + y</code>):</p>
<pre><code>Transform1(d, x, n, y, [](auto d, const auto v, const auto v1) HWY_ATTR {
  return MulAdd(Set(d, alpha), v, v1);
});</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Process whole vectors as above, followed by a scalar loop:</p>
<pre><code>size_t i = 0;
for (; i + N &lt;= count; i += N) LoopBody&lt;false&gt;(d, i, 0);
for (; i &lt; count; ++i) LoopBody&lt;false&gt;(CappedTag&lt;T, 1&gt;(), i, 0);</code></pre>
<p>The template parameter and second function arguments are again not
needed.</p>
<p>This avoids duplicating code, and is reasonable if <code>count</code>
is large. If <code>count</code> is small, the second loop may be slower
than the next option.</p></li>
<li><p>Process whole vectors as above, followed by a single call to a
modified <code>LoopBody</code> with masking:</p>
<pre><code>size_t i = 0;
for (; i + N &lt;= count; i += N) {
  LoopBody&lt;false&gt;(d, i, 0);
}
if (i &lt; count) {
  LoopBody&lt;true&gt;(d, i, count - i);
}</code></pre>
<p>Now the template parameter and third function argument can be used
inside <code>LoopBody</code> to non-atomically ‘blend’ the first
<code>num_remaining</code> lanes of <code>v</code> with the previous
contents of memory at subsequent locations:
<code>BlendedStore(v, FirstN(d, num_remaining), d, pointer);</code>.
Similarly, <code>MaskedLoad(FirstN(d, num_remaining), d, pointer)</code>
loads the first <code>num_remaining</code> elements and returns zero in
other lanes.</p>
<p>This is a good default when it is infeasible to ensure vectors are
padded, but is only safe <code>#if !HWY_MEM_OPS_MIGHT_FAULT</code>! In
contrast to the scalar loop, only a single final iteration is needed.
The increased code size from two loop bodies is expected to be
worthwhile because it avoids the cost of masking in all but the final
iteration.</p></li>
