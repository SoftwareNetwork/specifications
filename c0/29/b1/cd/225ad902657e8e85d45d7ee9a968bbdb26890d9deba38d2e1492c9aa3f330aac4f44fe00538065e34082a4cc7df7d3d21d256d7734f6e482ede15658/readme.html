<h2 id="x-window-system-unified-protocol">X Window System Unified
Protocol</h2>
<p>This package provides the headers and specification documents
defining the core protocol and (many) extensions for the X Window
System. The extensions are those common among servers descended from
X11R7. It also includes a number of headers that arenâ€™t purely protocol
related, but are depended upon by many other X Window System packages to
provide common definitions and porting layer.</p>
<p>Though the protocol specifications herein are authoritative, the
content of the headers is bound by compatibility constraints with older
versions of the X11 suite. If you are looking for a machine-readable
protocol description suitable for code generation or use in new
projects, please refer to the XCB project:</p>

<h2 id="updating-for-new-linux-kernel-releases">Updating for new Linux
kernel releases</h2>
<p>The XF86keysym.h header file needs updating whenever the Linux kernel
adds a new keycode to linux/input-event-codes.h. See the comment in
include/X11/XF86keysym.h for details on the format.</p>
<p>The steps to update the file are:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the kernel release did not add new <code>KEY_FOO</code> defines,
no work is required</li>
<li>ensure that libevdev has been updated to the new kernel headers.
This may require installing libevdev from git.</li>
<li>run <code>scripts/keysym-generator.py</code> to add new keysyms. See
the <code>--help</code> output for the correct invocation.</li>
<li>verify that the format for any keys added by this script is correct
and that the keys need to be mapped. Where a key code should not get a
new define or is already defined otherwise, comment the line.</li>
<li>file a merge request with the new changes</li>
<li>notify the xkeyboard-config maintainers that updates are needed</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that any #define added immediately becomes API. Due diligence is
recommended.</p>
