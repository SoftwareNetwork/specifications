<p><strong>Important</strong>: Please use DosBox emulator on mobile devices because it requires small CPU power. Nuked OPL synthesizer is very accurate (compared to real OPL3 chip), but it requires much more power device and is high probability your device will lag and playback will be choppy.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1</strong>: If you want to work with custom WOPL banks without using of embedded banks, you can create them by using <a href="https://github.com/Wohlstand/OPL3BankEditor">OPL3 Bank Editor</a> where also included some WOPL examples, or you are able to save any other bank as WOPL.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 2</strong>: To compile libADLMIDI without embedded banks, define the <code>DISABLE_EMBEDDED_BANKS</code> macro and remove building of the <code>adldata.cpp</code> file in your project.</p>
<h1 id="example">Example</h1>
<p>In the utils/midiplay you will found an example project which uses this library. That example is a simple audio player based on SDL Audio usage.</p>
<p>To build that example you will need to have installed SDL2 library.</p>
