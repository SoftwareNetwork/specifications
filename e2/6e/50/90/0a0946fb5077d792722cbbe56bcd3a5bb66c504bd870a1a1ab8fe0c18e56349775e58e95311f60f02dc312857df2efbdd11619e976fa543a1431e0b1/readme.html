<p>libdict is a C library that provides the following data structures with efficient insert, lookup, and delete routines:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree">height-balanced (AVL) tree</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_tree">red-black tree</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree">splay tree</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight-balanced_tree">weight-balanced tree</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/research/tr/1982/CS-82-07.pdf">path-reduction tree</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treap">treap</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtable#Separate_chaining">hashtable using separate chaining</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtable#Open_addressing">hashtable using open addressing with linear probing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list">skip list</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All data structures in this library support insert, search, and remove, and have bidirectional iterators. The sorted data structures (everything but hash tables) support near-search operations: searching for the key greater or equal to, strictly greater than, lesser or equal to, or strictly less than, a given key. The tree data structures also support the selecting the nth element; this takes linear time, except in path-reduction and weight-balanced trees, where it only takes logarithmic time.</p>
<p>The API and code are written with efficiency as a primary concern. For example, an insert call returns a boolean indicating whether or not the key was already present in the dictionary (i.e. whether there was an insertion or a collision), and a pointer to the location of the associated data. Thus, an insert-or-update operation can be supported with a single traversal of the data structure. In addition, almost all recursive algorithms have been rewritten to use iteration instead.</p>
