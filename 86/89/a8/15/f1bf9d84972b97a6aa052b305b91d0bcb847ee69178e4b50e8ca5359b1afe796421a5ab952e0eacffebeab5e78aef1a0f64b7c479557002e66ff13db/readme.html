<p>OpenAL Soft is an LGPL-licensed, cross-platform, software
implementation of the OpenAL 3D audio API. It’s forked from the
open-sourced Windows version available originally from openal.org’s SVN
repository (now defunct). OpenAL provides capabilities for playing audio
in a virtual 3D environment. Distance attenuation, doppler shift, and
directional sound emitters are among the features handled by the API.
More advanced effects, including air absorption, occlusion, and
environmental reverb, are available through the EFX extension. It also
facilitates streaming audio, multi-channel buffers, and audio
capture.</p>
<p>More information is available on the <a
href="http://openal-soft.org/">official website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="source-install">Source Install</h2>
<p>To install OpenAL Soft, use your favorite shell to go into the build/
directory, and run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">cmake</span> ..</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, you can use any available CMake front-end, like
cmake-gui, ccmake, or your preferred IDE’s CMake project parser.</p>
<p>Assuming configuration went well, you can then build it. The command
<code>cmake --build .</code> will instruct CMake to build the project
with the toolchain chosen during configuration (often GNU Make or NMake,
although others are possible).</p>
<p>Please Note: Double check that the appropriate backends were
detected. Often, complaints of no sound, crashing, and missing devices
can be solved by making sure the correct backends are being used.
CMake’s output will identify which backends were enabled.</p>
<p>For most systems, you will likely want to make sure PipeWire,
PulseAudio, and ALSA were detected (if your target system uses them).
For Windows, make sure WASAPI was detected.</p>
<h2 id="building-openal-soft---using-vcpkg">Building openal-soft - Using
vcpkg</h2>
<p>You can download and install openal-soft using the <a
href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg">vcpkg</a> dependency
manager:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
./vcpkg integrate install
./vcpkg install openal-soft</code></pre>
<p>The openal-soft port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team
members and community contributors. If the version is out of date,
please <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg">create an issue or
pull request</a> on the vcpkg repository.</p>
<h2 id="utilities">Utilities</h2>
<p>The source package comes with an informational utility, openal-info,
and is built by default. It prints out information provided by the ALC
and AL sub- systems, including discovered devices, version information,
and extensions.</p>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>OpenAL Soft can be configured on a per-user and per-system basis.
This allows users and sysadmins to control information provided to
applications, as well as application-agnostic behavior of the library.
See alsoftrc.sample for available settings.</p>
