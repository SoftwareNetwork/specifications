<p>========================================================================== 1. Directory structure overview ==========================================================================</p>
<p>You will find some directories after decompressing the archive in which came the SDK. These are:</p>
<p>Documentation of irrXML. A short example showing how to use the parser with solution and make files. The source code of irrXML.</p>
<p>========================================================================== 2. How to use ==========================================================================</p>
<p>For Linux/Unix users: Simply go into the directory /example and run 'make'. This will create a sample project using irrXML.</p>
<p>Windows users: Just add the source files to your project. That's all. For more information see the documentation in the directory.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could compile irrXML as .lib, after this you would only need to use the irrXML.h header file, nothing more.</p>
<p>========================================================================== 3. Requirements ==========================================================================</p>
<p>You can use one of the following compilers/IDEs to develop applications with irrXML. However, other compilers/IDEs make work as well, we simply didn't test them.</p>
<ul>
<li>gcc 3.2</li>
<li>gcc 3.3</li>
<li>Visual Studio 6.0</li>
<li>Visual Studio.NET (7.0)</li>
<li>Visual Studio.NET 2003 (7.1)</li>
<li>Visual Studio.NET 2005 (8.0)</li>
<li>DevC++ 4.9 &amp; gcc (project files included)</li>
</ul>
