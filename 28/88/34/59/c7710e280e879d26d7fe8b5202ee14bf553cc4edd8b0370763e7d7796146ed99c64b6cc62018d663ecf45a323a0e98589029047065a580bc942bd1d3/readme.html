<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>STXXL is an implementation of the C++ standard template library STL for external memory (out-of-core) computations, i. e. STXXL implements containers and algorithms that can process huge volumes of data that only fit on disks. While the closeness to the STL supports ease of use and compatibility with existing applications, another design priority is high performance.</p>
