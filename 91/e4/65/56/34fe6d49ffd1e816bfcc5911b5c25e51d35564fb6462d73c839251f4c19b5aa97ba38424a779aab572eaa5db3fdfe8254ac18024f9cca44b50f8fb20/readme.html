<h2 id="xtrans---x-network-transport-layer-shared-code">xtrans - X Network Transport layer shared code</h2>
<p>xtrans is a library of code that is shared among various X packages to handle network protocol transport in a modular fashion, allowing a single place to add new transport types. It is used by the X server, libX11, libICE, the X font server, and related components.</p>
<p>It is however, <em>NOT</em> a shared library, but code which each consumer includes and builds it's own copy of with various #ifdef flags to make each copy slightly different. To support this in the modular build system, this package simply installs the C source files into $(prefix)/include/X11/Xtrans and installs a pkg-config file and an autoconf m4 macro file with the flags needed to use it.</p>
<p>Documentation of the xtrans API can be found in the included xtrans.xml file in DocBook XML format. If 'xmlto' is installed, you can generate text, html, postscript or pdf versions of the documentation by configuring the build with --enable-docs, which is the default.</p>
