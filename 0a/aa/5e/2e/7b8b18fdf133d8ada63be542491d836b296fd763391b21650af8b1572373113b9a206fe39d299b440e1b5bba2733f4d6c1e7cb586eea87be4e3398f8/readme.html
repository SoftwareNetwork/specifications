<p>Dlib is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools for creating complex software in C++ to solve real world problems. See <a href="http://dlib.net" class="uri">http://dlib.net</a> for the main project documentation and API reference.</p>

<p>Go into the examples folder and type:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="fu">mkdir</span> build<span class="kw">;</span> <span class="bu">cd</span> build<span class="kw">;</span> <span class="fu">cmake</span> .. <span class="kw">;</span> <span class="fu">cmake</span> --build .</code></pre></div>
<p>That will build all the examples. If you have a CPU that supports AVX instructions then turn them on like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="fu">mkdir</span> build<span class="kw">;</span> <span class="bu">cd</span> build<span class="kw">;</span> <span class="fu">cmake</span> .. -DUSE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS=1<span class="kw">;</span> <span class="fu">cmake</span> --build .</code></pre></div>
<p>Doing so will make some things run faster.</p>
<p>Finally, Visual Studio users should usually do everything in 64bit mode. By default Visual Studio is 32bit, both in its outputs and its own execution, so you have to explicitly tell it to use 64bits. Since it's not the 1990s anymore you probably want to use 64bits. Do that with a cmake invocation like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="fu">cmake</span> .. -G <span class="st">&quot;Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64&quot;</span> -T host=x64 </code></pre></div>

<p>The examples folder has a <a href="https://github.com/davisking/dlib/blob/master/examples/CMakeLists.txt">CMake tutorial</a> that tells you what to do. There are also additional instructions on the <a href="http://dlib.net/compile.html">dlib web site</a>.</p>
<h2 id="compiling-dlib-python-api">Compiling dlib Python API</h2>
<p>Before you can run the Python example programs you must compile dlib. Type:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">python</span> setup.py install</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="running-the-unit-test-suite">Running the unit test suite</h2>
<p>Type the following to compile and run the dlib unit test suite:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="bu">cd</span> dlib/test
<span class="fu">mkdir</span> build
<span class="bu">cd</span> build
<span class="fu">cmake</span> ..
<span class="fu">cmake</span> --build . --config Release
<span class="ex">./dtest</span> --runall</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that on windows your compiler might put the test executable in a subfolder called <code>Release</code>. If that's the case then you have to go to that folder before running the test.</p>
