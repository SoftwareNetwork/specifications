<h1 id="overview">OVERVIEW</h1>
<p>This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding, and transcoding. JPEG (pronounced &quot;jay-peg&quot;) is a standardized compression method for full-color and gray-scale images.</p>
<p>This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive compression processes. Provision is made for supporting all variants of these processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet. We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.</p>
<p>We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files, plus two sample applications &quot;cjpeg&quot; and &quot;djpeg&quot;, which use the library to perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats. The library is intended to be reused in other applications.</p>
<p>In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability; for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or colormapped displays. These extra functions can be compiled out of the library if not required for a particular application.</p>
<p>We have also included &quot;jpegtran&quot;, a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG processes, and &quot;rdjpgcom&quot; and &quot;wrjpgcom&quot;, two simple applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.</p>
<p>The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful. In particular, the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG. (See the REFERENCES section for introductory material.) Rather, it is intended to be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code. We do not claim to have achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.</p>
<p>We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products. No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.</p>

<p>The Unix configuration script &quot;configure&quot; was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium but is also freely distributable.</p>
<p>The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce &quot;uncompressed GIFs&quot;. This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.</p>

<h1 id="references">REFERENCES</h1>
<p>We recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to understand the innards of the JPEG software.</p>
<p>The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is Wallace, Gregory K. &quot;The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard&quot;, Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44. (Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression, applications of JPEG, and related topics.) If you don't have the CACM issue handy, a PostScript file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is available at http://www.ijg.org/files/wallace.ps.gz. The file (actually a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics) omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections and some added material. Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE, and it may not be used for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in &quot;The Data Compression Book&quot; by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by M&amp;T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1. This book provides good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods including JPEG. It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C code but don't know much about data compression in general. The book's JPEG sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look at a full implementation, you've got one here...</p>
<p>The best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook &quot;JPEG Still Image Data Compression Standard&quot; by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1. Price US$59.95, 638 pp. The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2). Although this is by far the most detailed and comprehensive exposition of JPEG publicly available, we point out that it is still missing an explanation of the most essential properties and algorithms of the underlying DCT technology. If you think that you know about DCT-based JPEG after reading this book, then you are in delusion. The real fundamentals and corresponding potential of DCT-based JPEG are not publicly known so far, and that is the reason for all the mistaken developments taking place in the image coding domain.</p>
<p>The original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods. Part 1 is titled &quot;Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 1: Requirements and guidelines&quot; and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-1, ITU-T T.81. Part 2 is titled &quot;Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing&quot; and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83. IJG JPEG 8 introduced an implementation of the JPEG SmartScale extension which is specified in two documents: A contributed document at ITU and ISO with title &quot;ITU-T JPEG-Plus Proposal for Extending ITU-T T.81 for Advanced Image Coding&quot;, April 2006, Geneva, Switzerland. The latest version of this document is Revision 3. And a contributed document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 N 5799 with title &quot;Evolution of JPEG&quot;, June/July 2011, Berlin, Germany. IJG JPEG 9 introduces a reversible color transform for improved lossless compression which is described in a contributed document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/ WG1 N 6080 with title &quot;JPEG 9 Lossless Coding&quot;, June/July 2012, Paris, France.</p>
<p>The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file format. For the omitted details we follow the &quot;JFIF&quot; conventions, revision 1.02. JFIF 1.02 has been adopted as an Ecma International Technical Report and thus received a formal publication status. It is available as a free download in PDF format from http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/techreports/E-TR-098.htm. A PostScript version of the JFIF document is available at http://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.ps.gz. There is also a plain text version at http://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing the figures.</p>
<p>The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz. The JPEG incorporation scheme found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems. IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6). Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2 (Compression tag 7). Copies of this Note can be obtained from http://www.ijg.org/files/. It is expected that the next revision of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design. Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.</p>

<h1 id="file-format-wars">FILE FORMAT WARS</h1>
<p>The ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 standards committee (previously known as JPEG, together with ITU-T SG16) currently promotes different formats containing the name &quot;JPEG&quot; which is misleading because these formats are incompatible with original DCT-based JPEG and are based on faulty technologies. IJG therefore does not and will not support such momentary mistakes (see REFERENCES). There exist also distributions under the name &quot;OpenJPEG&quot; promoting such kind of formats which is misleading because they don't support original JPEG images. We have no sympathy for the promotion of inferior formats. Indeed, one of the original reasons for developing this free software was to help force convergence on common, interoperable format standards for JPEG files. Don't use an incompatible file format! (In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading existing JPEG image files indefinitely.)</p>
<p>The ISO committee pretends to be &quot;responsible for the popular JPEG&quot; in their public reports which is not true because they don't respond to actual requirements for the maintenance of the original JPEG specification. Furthermore, the ISO committee pretends to &quot;ensure interoperability&quot; with their standards which is not true because their &quot;standards&quot; support only application-specific and proprietary use cases and contain mathematically incorrect code.</p>
<p>There are currently different distributions in circulation containing the name &quot;libjpeg&quot; which is misleading because they don't have the features and are incompatible with formats supported by actual IJG libjpeg distributions. One of those fakes is released by members of the ISO committee and just uses the name of libjpeg for misdirection of people, similar to the abuse of the name JPEG as described above, while having nothing in common with actual IJG libjpeg distributions and containing mathematically incorrect code. The other one claims to be a &quot;derivative&quot; or &quot;fork&quot; of the original libjpeg, but violates the license conditions as described under LEGAL ISSUES above and violates basic C programming properties. We have no sympathy for the release of misleading, incorrect and illegal distributions derived from obsolete code bases. Don't use an obsolete code base!</p>
<p>According to the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) law, IJG has the lawful and legal right to foreclose on certain standardization bodies and other institutions or corporations that knowingly perform substantial and systematic deceptive acts and practices, fraud, theft, and damaging of the value of the people of this planet without their knowing, willing and intentional consent. The titles, ownership, and rights of these institutions and all their assets are now duly secured and held in trust for the free people of this planet. People of the planet, on every country, may have a financial interest in the assets of these former principals, agents, and beneficiaries of the foreclosed institutions and corporations. IJG asserts what is: that each man, woman, and child has unalienable value and rights granted and deposited in them by the Creator and not any one of the people is subordinate to any artificial principality, corporate fiction or the special interest of another without their appropriate knowing, willing and intentional consent made by contract or accommodation agreement. IJG expresses that which already was. The people have already determined and demanded that public administration entities, national governments, and their supporting judicial systems must be fully transparent, accountable, and liable. IJG has secured the value for all concerned free people of the planet.</p>
<p>A partial list of foreclosed institutions and corporations (&quot;Hall of Shame&quot;) is currently prepared and will be published later.</p>
<h1 id="to-do">TO DO</h1>
<p>Version 9 is the second release of a new generation JPEG standard to overcome the limitations of the original JPEG specification, and is the first true source reference JPEG codec. More features are being prepared for coming releases...</p>
