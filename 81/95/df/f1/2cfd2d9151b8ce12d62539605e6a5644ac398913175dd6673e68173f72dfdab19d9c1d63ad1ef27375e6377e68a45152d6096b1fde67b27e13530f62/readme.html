<p>Fizz is a TLS 1.3 implementation.</p>
<p>Fizz currently supports TLS 1.3 drafts 28, 26 (both wire-compatible with the final specification), and 23. All major handshake modes are supported, including PSK resumption, early data, client authentication, and HelloRetryRequest.</p>
<p>More background and details are available on the <a href="https://code.fb.com/networking-traffic/deploying-tls-1-3-at-scale-with-fizz-a-performant-open-source-tls-library/">Facebook Code Blog</a>.</p>
<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
<p>Fizz largely depends on three libraries: <a href="https://www.github.com/facebook/folly">folly</a>, <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium">libsodium</a>.</p>
<h2 id="source-layout">Source Layout</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>fizz/crypto</code>: Cryptographic primitive implementations (most are wrapping OpenSSL or libsodium)</li>
<li><code>fizz/record</code>: TLS 1.3 record layer parsing</li>
<li><code>fizz/protocol</code>: Common protocol code shared between client and server</li>
<li><code>fizz/client</code>: Client protocol implementation</li>
<li><code>fizz/server</code>: Server protocol implementation</li>
<li><code>fizz/tool</code>: Example CLI app source</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>The core protocol implementations are in <code>ClientProtocol</code> and <code>ServerProtocol</code>. <code>FizzClientContext</code> and <code>FizzServerContext</code> provide configuration options. <code>FizzClient</code> and <code>FizzServer</code> (which both inherit from <code>FizzBase</code>) provide applications with an interface to interact with the state machine. <code>FizzClient</code>/<code>FizzServer</code> receives events from the application layer, invokes the correct event handler, and invokes the application <code>ActionVisitor</code> to process the actions.</p>
<p><code>AsyncFizzClient</code> and <code>AsyncFizzServer</code> provide implementations of the folly <code>AsyncTransportWrapper</code> interface. They own an underlying transport (for example <code>AsyncSocket</code>) and perform the TLS handshake and encrypt/decrypt application data.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Fizz has several important features needed from a modern TLS library.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>Fizz supports scatter/gather IO by default via folly's IOBufs, and will encrypt data in-place whenever possible, saving memcpys. Due to this and several other optimizations, we found in our load balancer benchmarks that Fizz has 10% higher throughput than our prior SSL library which uses folly's <a href="https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/io/async/AsyncSSLSocket.h">AsyncSSLSocket</a>. Fizz also consumes less memory per connection than AsyncSSLSocket.</p>
<h3 id="async-by-default">Async by default</h3>
<p>Fizz has asynchronous APIs to be able to offload functions like certificate signing and ticket decryption. The API is based on folly's <a href="https://github.com/facebook/folly/tree/master/folly/futures">Futures</a> for painless async programming.</p>
<h3 id="tls-features">TLS features</h3>
<p>Fizz supports APIs like exported keying material as well as zero-copy APIs needed to use TLS in other protocols like QUIC.</p>
<h3 id="secure-design-abstractions">Secure design abstractions</h3>
<p>Fizz is built on a custom state machine which uses the power of the C++ type system to treat states and actions as types of their own. As the code changes, this allows us to catch invalid state transitions as compilation errors instead of runtime errors and helps us move fast.</p>
<h2 id="sample-applications">Sample Applications</h2>
<p>Fizz includes an example program that showcases the basic client/server functionality supported by Fizz. The binary is called <code>fizz</code> and it has similar usage to the <code>openssl</code> or <code>bssl</code> commands.</p>
<p>For example, to start a TLS server on port 443 with a specified cert:</p>
<pre><code>fizz server -accept 443 -cert foo.pem -key foo.key</code></pre>
<p>Then, on the same host, you can connect with:</p>
<pre><code>fizz client -connect localhost:443</code></pre>
<p>Both ends will echo whatever data they receive and send any terminal input to the peer. Hitting CTRL+D on either end will terminate the connection.</p>
<p>The source code for this program can be found under <code>fizz/tool</code>.</p>
<h2 id="building">Building</h2>
<h3 id="ubuntu-16.04-lts">Ubuntu 16.04 LTS</h3>
<p>To begin, you should install the dependencies we need for build. This largely consists of <a href="https://github.com/facebook/folly">folly</a>'s dependencies, as well as <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium">libsodium</a>.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install \
    g++ \
    cmake \
    libboost-all-dev \
    libevent-dev \
    libdouble-conversion-dev \
    libgoogle-glog-dev \
    libgflags-dev \
    libiberty-dev \
    liblz4-dev \
    liblzma-dev \
    libsnappy-dev \
    make \
    zlib1g-dev \
    binutils-dev \
    libjemalloc-dev \
    libssl-dev \
    pkg-config \
    libsodium-dev</code></pre>
<p>Then, build and install folly:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/facebook/folly
mkdir folly/build_ &amp;&amp; cd folly/build_
cmake ..
make -j $(nproc)
sudo make install</code></pre>
<p>And lastly, build and install fizz.</p>
<pre><code>cd ../..
git clone https://github.com/facebookincubator/fizz
mkdir fizz/build_ &amp;&amp; cd fizz/build_
cmake ../fizz
make -j $(nproc)
sudo make install</code></pre>
<h3 id="building-on-mac">Building on Mac</h3>
<p>The following instructions were tested on MacOS High Sierra with Xcode 9.4.1. They should work with later Xcode versions as well.</p>
<p>Run the helper script from within the <code>fizz</code> subdirectory. The helper script assumes that you have homebrew installed and are using homebrew as your package manager. To install homebrew use the instructions on the homebrew <a href="https://brew.sh/">website</a>.</p>
<p>It will install and link the required dependencies and also build folly. This may take several minutes the first time.</p>
<pre><code>cd fizz
./mac-build.sh</code></pre>
<p>After building, the directory <code>out/</code> will contain the libraries as well as <code>out/bin</code> will contain the <code>ClientSocket</code> and <code>ServerSocket</code> binaries. Running it again will be faster and only rebuild <code>fizz</code>.</p>
<p>You can also install both <code>fizz</code> as well as <code>folly</code> to a custom directory using the build script, by supplying an <code>INSTALL_PREFIX</code> env var.</p>
<pre><code>INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ./mac-build.sh</code></pre>
<p>You might need to run the script as root to install to certain directories.</p>
