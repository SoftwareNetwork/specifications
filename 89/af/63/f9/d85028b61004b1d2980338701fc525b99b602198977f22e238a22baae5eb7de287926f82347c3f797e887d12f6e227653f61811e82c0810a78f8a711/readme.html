<p>Nanopb is a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation in ansi C. It is especially suitable for use in microcontrollers, but fits any memory restricted system.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-nanopb-library">Using the nanopb library</h2>
<p>To use the nanopb library, you need to do two things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Compile your .proto files for nanopb, using <code>protoc</code>.</li>
<li>Include <em>pb_encode.c</em>, <em>pb_decode.c</em> and <em>pb_common.c</em> in your project.</li>
</ol>
<p>The easiest way to get started is to study the project in &quot;examples/simple&quot;. It contains a Makefile, which should work directly under most Linux systems. However, for any other kind of build system, see the manual steps in README.txt in that folder.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-protocol-buffers-compiler-protoc">Using the Protocol Buffers compiler (protoc)</h2>
<p>The nanopb generator is implemented as a plugin for the Google's own <code>protoc</code> compiler. This has the advantage that there is no need to reimplement the basic parsing of .proto files. However, it does mean that you need the Google's protobuf library in order to run the generator.</p>
<p>If you have downloaded a binary package for nanopb (either Windows, Linux or Mac OS X version), the <code>protoc</code> binary is included in the 'generator-bin' folder. In this case, you are ready to go. Simply run this command:</p>
<pre><code>generator-bin/protoc --nanopb_out=. myprotocol.proto</code></pre>
<p>However, if you are using a git checkout or a plain source distribution, you need to provide your own version of <code>protoc</code> and the Google's protobuf library. On Linux, the necessary packages are <code>protobuf-compiler</code> and <code>python-protobuf</code>. On Windows, you can either build Google's protobuf library from source or use one of the binary distributions of it. In either case, if you use a separate <code>protoc</code>, you need to manually give the path to nanopb generator:</p>
<pre><code>protoc --plugin=protoc-gen-nanopb=nanopb/generator/protoc-gen-nanopb ...</code></pre>
<h2 id="running-the-tests">Running the tests</h2>
<p>If you want to perform further development of the nanopb core, or to verify its functionality using your compiler and platform, you'll want to run the test suite. The build rules for the test suite are implemented using Scons, so you need to have that installed (ex: <code>sudo apt install scons</code> on Ubuntu). To run the tests:</p>
<pre><code>cd tests
scons</code></pre>
<p>This will show the progress of various test cases. If the output does not end in an error, the test cases were successful.</p>
<p>Note: Mac OS X by default aliases 'clang' as 'gcc', while not actually supporting the same command line options as gcc does. To run tests on Mac OS X, use: &quot;scons CC=clang CXX=clang&quot;. Same way can be used to run tests with different compilers on any platform.</p>
