<p>LightLDA is a distributed system for large scale topic modeling. It implements a distributed sampler that enables very large data sizes and models. LightLDA improves sampling throughput and convergence speed via a fast O(1) metropolis-Hastings algorithm, and allows small cluster to tackle very large data and model sizes through model scheduling and data parallelism architecture. LightLDA is implemented with C++ for performance consideration.</p>
<p>We have sucessfully trained big topic models (with trillions of parameters) on big data (Top 10% PageRank values of Bing indexed page, containing billions of documents) in Microsoft.

<h2 id="why-lightlda">Why LightLDA</h2>
<p>The highlight features of LightLDA are</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scalable</strong>: LightLDA can train models with trillions of parameters on big data with billions of documents, a scale previous implementations cann't handle.</li>
<li><strong>Fast</strong>: The sampler can sample millions of tokens per second per multi-core node.</li>
<li><strong>Lightweight</strong>: Such big tasks can be trained with as few as tens of machines.</li>
</ul>
