<p>This file is just a placeholder; all the documentation is now in HTML in the html directory. To view the documentation point your favorite WWW viewer at html/index.html;</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<pre><code>firefox html/index.html</code></pre>
<p>If you don't have an HTML viewer then you can read the HTML source or fetch a PostScript version of this documentation from the directory</p>
<pre><code>http://download.osgeo.org/libtiff/</code></pre>
<p>If you can't hack either of these options then basically what you want to do is:</p>
<pre><code>% ./configure
% make
% su
# make install</code></pre>
