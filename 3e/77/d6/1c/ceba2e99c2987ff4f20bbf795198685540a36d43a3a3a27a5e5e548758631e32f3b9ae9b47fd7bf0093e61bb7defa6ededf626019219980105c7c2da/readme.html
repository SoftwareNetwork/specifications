<p>OpenAL Soft is an LGPL-licensed, cross-platform, software implementation of the OpenAL 3D audio API. It's forked from the open-sourced Windows version available originally from openal.org's SVN repository (now defunct). OpenAL provides capabilities for playing audio in a virtual 3D environment. Distance attenuation, doppler shift, and directional sound emitters are among the features handled by the API. More advanced effects, including air absorption, occlusion, and environmental reverb, are available through the EFX extension. It also facilitates streaming audio, multi-channel buffers, and audio capture.</p>

<h2 id="source-install">Source Install</h2>
<p>To install OpenAL Soft, use your favorite shell to go into the build/ directory, and run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="fu">cmake</span> ..</code></pre></div>
<p>Assuming configuration went well, you can then build it, typically using GNU Make (KDevelop, MSVC, and others are possible depending on your system setup and CMake configuration).</p>
<p>Please Note: Double check that the appropriate backends were detected. Often, complaints of no sound, crashing, and missing devices can be solved by making sure the correct backends are being used. CMake's output will identify which backends were enabled.</p>
<p>For most systems, you will likely want to make sure ALSA, OSS, and PulseAudio were detected (if your target system uses them). For Windows, make sure DirectSound was detected.</p>
<h2 id="utilities">Utilities</h2>
<p>The source package comes with an informational utility, openal-info, and is built by default. It prints out information provided by the ALC and AL sub- systems, including discovered devices, version information, and extensions.</p>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>OpenAL Soft can be configured on a per-user and per-system basis. This allows users and sysadmins to control information provided to applications, as well as application-agnostic behavior of the library. See alsoftrc.sample for available settings.</p>
