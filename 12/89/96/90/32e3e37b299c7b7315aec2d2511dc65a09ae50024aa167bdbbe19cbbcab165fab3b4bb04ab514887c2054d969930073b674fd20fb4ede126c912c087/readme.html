<h1 id="vulkan-loader">Vulkan Loader</h1>
<p>This project provides the Khronos official Vulkan Loader for all
platforms except <a
href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/native/+/master/vulkan/">Android</a></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Vulkan is an explicit API, enabling direct control over how GPUs
actually work. As such, Vulkan supports systems that have multiple GPUs,
each running with a different driver, or ICD (Installable Client
Driver). Vulkan also supports multiple global contexts (instances, in
Vulkan terminology). The ICD loader is a library that is placed between
a Vulkan application and any number of Vulkan drivers, in order to
support multiple drivers and the instance-level functionality that works
across these drivers. Additionally, the loader manages inserting Vulkan
layer libraries, such as validation layers, between an application and
the drivers.</p>
<p>This repository contains the Vulkan loader that is used for Linux,
Windows, MacOS, and iOS. There is also a separate loader, maintained by
Google, which is used on Android.</p>

<p><a href="BUILD.md">BUILD.md</a> includes directions for building all
components.</p>
<p>Architecture and interface information for the loader is in <a

<h2 id="version-tagging-scheme">Version Tagging Scheme</h2>
<p>Updates to this repository which correspond to a new Vulkan
specification release are tagged using the following format:
<code>v&lt;</code><em><code>version</code></em><code>&gt;</code> (e.g.,
<code>v1.3.266</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Marked version releases have undergone
thorough testing but do not imply the same quality level as SDK tags.
SDK tags follow the
<code>vulkan-sdk-&lt;</code><em><code>version</code></em><code>&gt;.&lt;</code><em><code>patch</code></em><code>&gt;</code>
format (e.g., <code>vulkan-sdk-1.3.266.0</code>).</p>
<p>This scheme was adopted following the <code>1.3.266</code> Vulkan
specification release.</p>
