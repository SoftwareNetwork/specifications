<h1 id="boost-staticassert-library">Boost StaticAssert Library</h1>
<p>The Boost StaticAssert library provides static assertions for C++,
this library is the ancestor to C++ native static_assert’s and can be
used on older compilers which don’t have that feature.</p>
<p>The full documentation is available on <a
href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/static_assert">boost.org</a>.</p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>Clone the whole boost project, which includes the individual Boost
projects as submodules (<a
href="https://github.com/boostorg/boost/wiki/Getting-Started">see
boost+git doc</a>):</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/boostorg/boost
cd boost
git submodule update --init</code></pre>
<p>The Boost StaticAssert Library is located in
<code>libs/static_assert/</code>.</p>
<h3 id="running-tests">Running tests</h3>
<p>First, make sure you are in <code>libs/static_assert/test</code>. You
can either run all the tests listed in <code>Jamfile.v2</code> or run a
single test:</p>
<pre><code>../../../b2                        &lt;- run all tests
../../../b2 static_assert_test     &lt;- single test</code></pre>
