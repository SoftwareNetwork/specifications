<h2 id="bitmagic-c-library">BitMagic C++ Library</h2>
<p>Algorithms and tools for Algebra od Sets for information retrieval, indexing of databases, scientific algorithms, ranking, clustering, unsupervised machine learning and signal processing.</p>
<p>BitMagic library uses compressed bit-vectors as a main vehicle for implementing set algebraic operations, because of high efficiency and bit-level parallelism friendly for parallel processing with SIMD.</p>
<h3 id="main-features">Main Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>compressed bit-vector container with mechanisms to iterate integer set it represents</li>
<li>set algebraic operations: AND, OR, XOR, MINUS, NOT on bit-vectors and integer sets</li>
<li>fast bit-vector ierator (enumerator) for bit-vector traversal, algorithms for functor-based traversals (similar to for_each)</li>
<li>fast import (compression) of integer lists (C++ style bulk_insert_iterator or using C array)</li>
<li>aggregator: fast logical AND, OR, AND-MINUS operations on groups of bit-vectors</li>
<li>serialization/hybernation of bit-vector containers into compressed BLOBs for persistence (or in-RAM compression)</li>
<li>set algebraic operations on compressed BLOBs (on the fly deserialization with set-algebraic function)</li>
<li>statistical algorithms to efficiently construct similarity and distance metrics, measure similarity between bit-vectors, integer sets and compressed BLOBs</li>
<li>operations with rank: population count distances on bit-vector. Rank-Select operations are often used in succinct data structures.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="succinct-vectors">Succinct vectors</h3>
<p>BitMagic supports succinct (memory compact) vectors based on bit-transposition and bit-vectors. Compression on bit-planes offers both superior memory performance and fast search.</p>
<ul>
<li>sparse vector(s) for native int types using bit transposition and separate compression of bit-plains, with support of NULL values (unassigned) for construction of in-memory columnar structures. Bit-transposed sparse vectors can be used for on-the fly compression of astronomical, molecular biology or other data, efficient store of associations for graphs, etc.</li>
<li>search algorithms for sorted and unsorted succinct vectors (vectors of ints or strings)</li>
<li>algorithms on sparse vectors: dynamic range clipping, search, group theory image (re-mapping).</li>
<li>all containers are serializable</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bit">64-bit</h3>
<p>Yes! BitMagic supports 64-bit, can be used with 32-bit address space (less overhead) or 64-bit address space. 32-bit address space is the default mode 2^31-1 elements should be a good fit for short to medium range search systems. 64-bit address mode is available using #define BM64ADDR or #include &quot;bm64.h&quot;. Current 64-bit implementation now allows 2^48-1 elements for large scale systems.</p>
<h3 id="c-library-interface">C-library interface:</h3>
<ul>
<li>BitMagic library provides C-library wrapper, which builds as a &quot;true C&quot; library. For redistribution it does NOT require C++ Runtime, because it compiles without use of STL, C++ memory allocation (operator new) or exceptions. Our goal here is to eventually provide a bridge to other languiages of data science (Python) and languages of enterprise scale development (Java, Scala) via JNI.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="features-in-progress">Features In Progress:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>compressed binary relational and adjacency matrixes and operations on matrixes for Entity-Relationship acceleration, graph operations, social analyticsm materialized RDBMS joins, etc</p></li>
<li><p>succinct data structures and containers based on bit-transposed data representation and rank-select compression</p></li>
<li><p>memory efficient dictionaries of strings as an alternative to suffix trees</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Apache 2.0.</p>
<p><strong>Important!</strong> We ask you to explicitly mention BitMagic project in any derived work or our published materials. Proper reference on your product/project page is a REQUIREMENT for using BitMagic Library.</p>
<h3 id="quality-assurance">Quality Assurance:</h3>
<p>BitMagic library pays serious attention to code quality and test coverage.<br />
As a low level library BitMagic needs to be stable and conformant to be useful.</p>
<p>We do not rely on unit tests alone, our tests often use <em>&quot;chaos testing&quot;</em> where stress tests are based on randomized, generated sets and randomized operations. We regularly build and run test suits for Release and Debug mode for various combinations of SIMD optimizations.</p>
<p>All variants of test builds take days to run, so the working master branch is not guaranteed to be perfect.</p>
<p>All of the above does not guarantee it is bug free project.</p>
<h3 id="simd-support">SIMD support:</h3>
<p>BitMagic provides fast algorithms optimized for various SIMD sets, exploit super-scalar features of modern CPUs, cache-friendly algorithms and thread-safe and data-parallel structures. High-performance is a priority!</p>
<ul>
<li>SSE2 - Intel SSE2 command set is supported, but gets gradually phased out, no new algorithms and compute kernels</li>
<li>SSE4.2 - Supported</li>
<li>AVX2 - Supported and recommended as fastest for high-performance systems</li>
<li>AVX-512 - Work in progress. Some algorithms are ready(and stable), but we cannot get performance right (yet). AVX-512 projects using BitMagic for now should just use AVX2 mode (it is compatible).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="if-you-want-to-contribute-or-support-bitmagic-library">### If you want to contribute or support BitMagic library:</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>GitHub master accepts patch requests Our branching policy is that master cannot be considered fully stable between the releases. (for production stability please use release versions)</p></li>
<li><p>Need help with mappings to Python and other languages (BitMagic has C bindings)</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-build-bitmagic-c-library">### How to build BitMagic C++ library:</h2>
<p>BitMagic C++ is a header-only software package and you probably can just take the sources and put it into your project directly. All C++ library sources/headers are in src directory.</p>
<p>However if you want to use our makefiles you need to follow the next simple instructions:</p>
<h2 id="unix">###### Unix:</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Traditional (in-place build)</li>
</ol>
<p>Apply a few environment variables by runing bmenv.sh in the project root directory:</p>
<pre><code>$ . ./bmenv.sh</code></pre>
<p>(please use &quot;.&quot; &quot;./bmenv.sh&quot; to apply root environment variable)</p>
<p>use GNU make (gmake) to build installation.</p>
<pre><code>$make rebuild</code></pre>
<p>or (DEBUG version)</p>
<pre><code>$gmake DEBUG=YES rebuild</code></pre>
<p>The default compiler on Unix and CygWin is g++. If you want to change the default you can do that in makefile.in (should be pretty easy to do)</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>CMake based build Project now comes with a set of makefiles for cmake, you can just build it or generate project files for any cmake-supported environment.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="windows">###### Windows:</h2>
<p>If you use cygwin installation please follow general Unix recommendations. MSVC - solution and projects are available via CMAKE generation</p>
<h2 id="macos">###### MacOS</h2>
<p>XCODE - project files are available via CMAKE generation</p>
<hr />
<p>BitMagic library for C and JNI mappings.</p>
<p>BitMagic library is available for C language (this is work in progress). The main objective of C build is to bridge BitMagic into other programming languages. C build is in the subdirectory &quot;lang-maps&quot;.</p>
<p>C build creates versions of BitMagic build for SSE and AVX and adds CPU identification, so the upper level system can support dynamic CPU identification and code dispatch.</p>
<p>C build uses C++ compiler, but does not use RTTI, exceptions (simulated with long jump) and C++ memory management, so it is C++ language neutral, without runtime dependencies. Algorithms and behavior are shared between C and C++.</p>
<p>Current state of development: - bit-vector functionality is available via C interface</p>
<h4 id="python-support">Python support</h4>
<p>Yes, we need it! If you are enthusiastic about Python and think you can help please contact: anatoliy.kuznetsov @ yahoo dot com</p>
<h2 id="fine-tuning-and-optimizations">Fine tuning and optimizations:</h2>
<p>All BM fine tuning parameters are controlled by the preprocessor defines (and compiler keys).</p>
<hr />
<p>BM library supports CXX-11. Move semantics, noexept, initalizer lists.</p>
<hr />
<p>To turn on SSE2 optimization #define BMSSE2OPT in your build environment. To use SSE4.2 #define BMSSE42OPT SSE42 optimization automatically assumes SSE2 as a subset of SSE4.2. (you donâ€™t have to use both BMSSE2OPT and BMSSE42OPT at the same time).</p>
<p>To turn on AVX2 - #define BMAVX2OPT This will automatically enable AVX2 256-bit SIMD, popcount (SSE4.2) and other compatible hardware instructions.</p>
<p>BM library does NOT support multiple code paths and runtime CPU identification. You have to build specifically for your target system or use default portable build.</p>
<p>To correctly build for the target SIMD instruction set - please set correct code generation flags for the build environment.</p>
<p>BitMagic examples and tests can be build with GCC using cmd-line settings:</p>
<pre><code>make BMOPTFLAGS=-DBMAVX2OPT rebuild</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>make BMOPTFLAGS=-DBMSSE42OPT rebuild</code></pre>
<p>It automatically applies the right set of compiler (GCC) flags for the target build.</p>
<pre><code>CMAKE

cd build
cmake -DBMOPTFLAGS:STRING=BMSSE42OPT ..
make</code></pre>
<p>OR</p>
<pre><code>cmake -DBMOPTFLAGS:STRING=BMAVX2OPT ..</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>BM library supports &quot;restrict&quot; keyword, some compilers (for example Intel C++) generate better code (out of order load-stores) when restrict keyword is helping. This option is turned OFF by default since most of the C++ compilers does not support it. To turn it ON please #define BM_HASRESTRICT in your project. Some compilers use &quot;__restrict&quot; keyword for this purpose. To correct it define BMRESTRICT macro to correct keyword.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you want to use BM library in a &quot;no-STL project&quot; (like embedded systems) define BM_NO_STL.</p>
<p>This rule only applies to the core bm::bvector&lt;&gt; methods. Auxiliary algorithms, examples, etc would still use STL.</p>
