<p>Many many developers all over the net respect NASM for what it is: a
widespread (thus netwide), portable (thus netwide!), very flexible and
mature assembler tool with support for many output formats (thus
netwide!!).</p>
<p>Now we have good news for you: NASM is licensed under the
“simplified” <a

license</a>. This means its development is open to even wider society of
programmers wishing to improve their lovely assembler.</p>
