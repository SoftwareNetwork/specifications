<p>MD4C stands for “Markdown for C” and that’s exactly what this project
is about.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-markdown">What is Markdown</h2>
<p>In short, Markdown is the markup language this <code>README.md</code>
file is written in.</p>
<p>The following resources can explain more if you are unfamiliar with
it: * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Wikipedia
article</a> * <a href="http://commonmark.org">CommonMark site</a></p>
<h2 id="what-is-md4c">What is MD4C</h2>
<p>MD4C is Markdown parser implementation in C, with the following
features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Compliance:</strong> Generally, MD4C aims to be compliant
to the latest version of <a
href="http://spec.commonmark.org/">CommonMark specification</a>.
Currently, we are fully compliant to CommonMark 0.31.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extensions:</strong> MD4C supports some commonly
requested and accepted extensions. See below.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Performance:</strong> MD4C is <a
href="https://talk.commonmark.org/t/2520">very fast</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compactness:</strong> MD4C parser is implemented in one
source file and one header file. There are no dependencies other than
standard C library.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Embedding:</strong> MD4C parser is easy to reuse in other
projects, its API is very straightforward: There is actually just one
function, <code>md_parse()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Push model:</strong> MD4C parses the complete document
and calls few callback functions provided by the application to inform
it about a start/end of every block, a start/end of every span, and with
any textual contents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Portability:</strong> MD4C builds and works on Windows
and POSIX-compliant OSes. (It should be simple to make it run also on
most other platforms, at least as long as the platform provides C
standard library, including a heap memory management.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Encoding:</strong> MD4C by default expects UTF-8 encoding
of the input document. But it can be compiled to recognize ASCII-only
control characters (i.e. to disable all Unicode-specific code), or (on
Windows) to expect UTF-16 (i.e. what is on Windows commonly called just
“Unicode”). See more details below.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Permissive license:</strong> MD4C is available under the
<a href="LICENSE.md">MIT license</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-md4c">Using MD4C</h2>
<h3 id="parsing-markdown">Parsing Markdown</h3>
<p>If you need just to parse a Markdown document, you need to include
<code>md4c.h</code> and link against MD4C library (<code>-lmd4c</code>);
or alternatively add <code>md4c.[hc]</code> directly to your code base
as the parser is only implemented in the single C source file.</p>
<p>The main provided function is <code>md_parse()</code>. It takes a
text in the Markdown syntax and a pointer to a structure which provides
pointers to several callback functions.</p>
<p>As <code>md_parse()</code> processes the input, it calls the
callbacks (when entering or leaving any Markdown block or span; and when
outputting any textual content of the document), allowing application to
convert it into another format or render it onto the screen.</p>
<h3 id="converting-to-html">Converting to HTML</h3>
<p>If you need to convert Markdown to HTML, include
<code>md4c-html.h</code> and link against MD4C-HTML library
(<code>-lmd4c-html</code>); or alternatively add the sources
<code>md4c.[hc]</code>, <code>md4c-html.[hc]</code> and
<code>entity.[hc]</code> into your code base.</p>
<p>To convert a Markdown input, call <code>md_html()</code> function. It
takes the Markdown input and calls the provided callback function. The
callback is fed with chunks of the HTML output. Typical callback
implementation just appends the chunks into a buffer or writes them to a
file.</p>
<h2 id="markdown-extensions">Markdown Extensions</h2>
<p>The default behavior is to recognize only Markdown syntax defined by
the <a href="http://spec.commonmark.org/">CommonMark
specification</a>.</p>
<p>However, with appropriate flags, the behavior can be tuned to enable
some extensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>With the flag <code>MD_FLAG_COLLAPSEWHITESPACE</code>, a
non-trivial whitespace is collapsed into a single space.</p></li>
<li><p>With the flag <code>MD_FLAG_TABLES</code>, GitHub-style tables
are supported.</p></li>
<li><p>With the flag <code>MD_FLAG_TASKLISTS</code>, GitHub-style task
lists are supported.</p></li>
<li><p>With the flag <code>MD_FLAG_STRIKETHROUGH</code>, strike-through
spans are enabled (text enclosed in tilde marks,
e.g. <code>~foo bar~</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>With the flag <code>MD_FLAG_PERMISSIVEURLAUTOLINKS</code>
permissive URL autolinks (not enclosed in <code>&lt;</code> and
<code>&gt;</code>) are supported.</p></li>
<li><p>With the flag <code>MD_FLAG_PERMISSIVEEMAILAUTOLINKS</code>,
permissive e-mail autolinks (not enclosed in <code>&lt;</code> and
<code>&gt;</code>) are supported.</p></li>
<li><p>With the flag <code>MD_FLAG_PERMISSIVEWWWAUTOLINKS</code>
permissive WWW autolinks without any scheme specified
(e.g. <code>www.example.com</code>) are supported. MD4C then assumes
<code>http:</code> scheme.</p></li>
<li><p>With the flag <code>MD_FLAG_LATEXMATHSPANS</code> LaTeX math
spans (<code>$...$</code>) and LaTeX display math spans
(<code>$$...$$</code>) are supported. (Note though that the HTML
renderer outputs them verbatim in a custom tag
<code>&lt;x-equation&gt;</code>.)</p></li>
<li><p>With the flag <code>MD_FLAG_WIKILINKS</code>, wiki-style links
(<code>[[link label]]</code> and
<code>[[target article|link label]]</code>) are supported. (Note that
the HTML renderer outputs them in a custom tag
<code>&lt;x-wikilink&gt;</code>.)</p></li>
<li><p>With the flag <code>MD_FLAG_UNDERLINE</code>, underscore
(<code>_</code>) denotes an underline instead of an ordinary emphasis or
strong emphasis.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Few features of CommonMark (those some people see as mis-features)
may be disabled with the following flags:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>With the flag <code>MD_FLAG_NOHTMLSPANS</code> or
<code>MD_FLAG_NOHTMLBLOCKS</code>, raw inline HTML or raw HTML blocks
respectively are disabled.</p></li>
<li><p>With the flag <code>MD_FLAG_NOINDENTEDCODEBLOCKS</code>, indented
code blocks are disabled.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="inputoutput-encoding">Input/Output Encoding</h2>
<p>The CommonMark specification declares that any sequence of Unicode
code points is a valid CommonMark document.</p>
<p>But, under a closer inspection, Unicode plays any role in few very
specific situations when parsing Markdown documents:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>For detection of word boundaries when processing emphasis and
strong emphasis, some classification of Unicode characters (whether it
is a whitespace or a punctuation) is needed.</p></li>
<li><p>For (case-insensitive) matching of a link reference label with
the corresponding link reference definition, Unicode case folding is
used.</p></li>
<li><p>For translating HTML entities (e.g. <code>&amp;amp;</code>) and
numeric character references (e.g. <code>&amp;#35;</code> or
<code>&amp;#xcab;</code>) into their Unicode equivalents.</p>
<p>However note MD4C leaves this translation on the
renderer/application; as the renderer is supposed to really know output
encoding and whether it really needs to perform this kind of
translation. (For example, when the renderer outputs HTML, it may leave
the entities untranslated and defer the work to a web browser.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>MD4C relies on this property of the CommonMark and the implementation
is, to a large degree, encoding-agnostic. Most of MD4C code only assumes
that the encoding of your choice is compatible with ASCII. I.e. that the
codepoints below 128 have the same numeric values as ASCII.</p>
<p>Any input MD4C does not understand is simply seen as part of the
document text and sent to the renderer’s callback functions
unchanged.</p>
<p>The two situations (word boundary detection and link reference
matching) where MD4C has to understand Unicode are handled as specified
by the following preprocessor macros (as specified at the time MD4C is
being built):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If preprocessor macro <code>MD4C_USE_UTF8</code> is defined, MD4C
assumes UTF-8 for the word boundary detection and for the
case-insensitive matching of link labels.</p>
<p>When none of these macros is explicitly used, this is the default
behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>On Windows, if preprocessor macro <code>MD4C_USE_UTF16</code> is
defined, MD4C uses <code>WCHAR</code> instead of <code>char</code> and
assumes UTF-16 encoding in those situations. (UTF-16 is what Windows
developers usually call just “Unicode” and what Win32API generally works
with.)</p>
<p>Note that because this macro affects also the types in
<code>md4c.h</code>, you have to define the macro both when building
MD4C as well as when including <code>md4c.h</code>.</p>
<p>Also note this is only supported in the parser
(<code>md4c.[hc]</code>). The HTML renderer does not support this and
you will have to write your own custom renderer to use this
feature.</p></li>
<li><p>If preprocessor macro <code>MD4C_USE_ASCII</code> is defined,
MD4C assumes nothing but an ASCII input.</p>
<p>That effectively means that non-ASCII whitespace or punctuation
characters won’t be recognized as such and that link reference matching
will work in a case-insensitive way only for ASCII letters
(<code>[a-zA-Z]</code>).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>The API of the parser is quite well documented in the comments in the
<code>md4c.h</code>. Similarly, the markdown-to-html API is described in
its header <code>md4c-html.h</code>.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="http://github.com/mity/md4c/wiki">project
wiki</a> which provides some more comprehensive documentation. However
note it is incomplete and some details may be somewhat outdated.</p>
<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Q: How does MD4C compare to other Markdown
parsers?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Some other implementations combine Markdown
parser and HTML generator into a single entangled code hidden behind an
interface which just allows the conversion from Markdown to HTML. They
are often unusable if you want to process the input in any other
way.</p>
<p>Second, most parsers (if not all of them; at least within the scope
of C/C++ language) are full DOM-like parsers: They construct abstract
syntax tree (AST) representation of the whole Markdown document. That
takes time and it leads to bigger memory footprint.</p>
<p>Build AST is completely fine as long as you really need it. If you
don’t need it, there is a very high chance that using MD4C will be
substantially faster and less hungry in terms of memory consumption.</p>
<p>Last but not least, some Markdown parsers are implemented in a naive
way. When fed with a <a href="test/pathological_tests.py">smartly
crafted input pattern</a>, they may exhibit quadratic (or even worse)
parsing times. What MD4C can still parse in a fraction of second may
turn into long minutes or possibly hours with them. Hence, when such a
naive parser is used to process an input from an untrusted source, the
possibility of denial-of-service attacks becomes a real danger.</p>
<p>A lot of our effort went into providing linear parsing times no
matter what kind of crazy input MD4C parser is fed with. (If you
encounter an input pattern which leads to a sub-linear parsing times,
please do not hesitate and report it as a bug.)</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does MD4C perform any input validation?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> No. And we are proud of it. :-)</p>
<p>CommonMark specification states that any sequence of Unicode
characters is a valid Markdown document. (In practice, this more or less
always means UTF-8 encoding.)</p>
<p>In other words, according to the specification, it does not matter
whether some Markdown syntax construction is in some way broken or not.
If it’s broken, it won’t be recognized and the parser should see it just
as a verbatim text.</p>
<p>MD4C takes this a step further: It sees any sequence of bytes as a
valid input, following completely the GIGO philosophy (garbage in,
garbage out). I.e. any ill-formed UTF-8 byte sequence will propagate to
the respective callback as a part of the text.</p>
<p>If you need to validate that the input is, say, a well-formed UTF-8
document, you have to do it on your own. The easiest way how to do this
is to simply validate the whole document before passing it to the MD4C
parser.</p>
