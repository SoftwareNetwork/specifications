<h1 id="pcg-random-number-generation-c-edition">PCG Random Number Generation, C++ Edition</h1>
<p>This code provides an implementation of the PCG family of random number generators, which are fast, statistically excellent, and offer a number of useful features.</p>
<p>Full details can be found at the <a href="http://www.pcg-random.org">PCG-Random website</a>. This version of the code provides many family members -- if you just want one simple generator, you may prefer the minimal C version of the library.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of generator, normal generators and extended generators. Extended generators provide <em>k</em> dimensional equidistribution and can perform party tricks, but generally speaking most people only need the normal generators.</p>
<p>There are two ways to access the generators, using a convenience typedef or by using the underlying templates directly (similar to C++11's <code>std::mt19937</code> typedef vs its <code>std::mersenne_twister_engine</code> template). For most users, the convenience typedef is what you want, and probably you're fine with <code>pcg32</code> for 32-bit numbers. If you want 64-bit numbers, either use <code>pcg64</code> (or, if you're on a 32-bit system, making 64 bits from two calls to <code>pcg32_k2</code> may be faster).</p>
<h2 id="documentation-and-examples">Documentation and Examples</h2>
<p>Visit <a href="http://www.pcg-random.org">PCG-Random website</a> for information on how to use this library, or look at the sample code in the <code>sample</code> directory -- hopefully it should be fairly self explanatory.</p>
<h2 id="building">Building</h2>
<p>The code is written in C++11, as an include-only library (i.e., there is nothing you need to build). There are some provided demo programs and tests however. On a Unix-style system (e.g., Linux, Mac OS X) you should be able to just type</p>
<pre><code>make</code></pre>
<p>To build the demo programs.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>Run</p>
<pre><code>make test</code></pre>
<h2 id="directory-structure">Directory Structure</h2>
<p>The directories are arranged as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>include</code> -- contains <code>pcg_random.hpp</code> and supporting include files</li>
<li><code>test-high</code> -- test code for the high-level API where the functions have shorter, less scary-looking names.</li>
<li><code>sample</code> -- sample code, some similar to the code in <code>test-high</code> but more human readable, some other examples too</li>
</ul>
