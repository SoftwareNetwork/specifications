<h1 id="about-libxcb">About libxcb</h1>
<p>libxcb provides an interface to the X Window System protocol, which
replaces the traditional Xlib interface. It has several advantages over
Xlib, including: - size: small, simple library, and lower memory
footprint - latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the
replies later - direct protocol access: interface and protocol
correspond exactly - proven thread support: transparently access XCB
from multiple threads - easy extension implementation: interfaces
auto-generated from XML-XCB</p>
<p>Xlib also uses XCB as a transport layer, allowing software to make
requests and receive responses with both, which eases porting to XCB.
However, client programs, libraries, and toolkits will gain the most
benefit from a native XCB port.</p>
