<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>mFAST is a high performance C++ encoding/decoding library for FAST (FIX Adapted for STreaming) protocol.</p>
<p>For more information, please read the <a href="http://objectcomputing.github.io/mFAST/">article</a>.</p>

<h3 id="important-notice">Important Notice</h3>
<p>[03/13/2016] mFAST has changed the licence from the LGPL v3 to the BSD 3-clause “New” or “Revised” license.</p>
<p>From now on, mFAST require C++ 11 to compile. You can check out the version with tag name &quot;v1.2.1&quot; if you need a C++ 03 only solution.</p>
<p>mFAST has limited support for FAST protocol version 1.2 now. That includes the new <code>define</code> and <code>type</code> tags in the FAST XML specification and the new enum/boolean types. In addition, the generated sequence types support iterators now. However, there is no support for <em>SET</em>, <em>BIT GROUP</em> and <em>TIMESTAMP</em> yet.</p>
<p>If you have used mFAST 1.1 version, please notice there are some backward-incompatible changes. First, to make a existing field absent, please use <code>msg_mref.omit_fieldName()</code> instead of <code>msg_mref.set_fieldName().as_absent()</code>. Second, if you have developed your own visitor for mFAST cref/mref types, the visitor has to be able to visit the new enum cref/mref types.</p>
<h4 id="using-mfast-across-the-web">Using mFAST across the web</h4>
<ul>
<li>OCI has successfully translated the mF AST source code into asm.js (an efficient subset of JavaScript).</li>
<li>The asm.js version of mFAST when used with Socket.io enables high volume data exchanges between browsers and servers.</li>
<li>This is an ideal data format for streaming graphs and feeds to web and mobile clients.</li>
<li>It can also go the other direction to stream from web and mobile clients.</li>
</ul>
