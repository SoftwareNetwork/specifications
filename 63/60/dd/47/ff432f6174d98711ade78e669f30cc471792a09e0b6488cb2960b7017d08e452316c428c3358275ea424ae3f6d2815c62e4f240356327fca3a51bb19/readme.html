QUIC &amp; HTTP3 transports</h1>
<p>µSockets is the non-blocking, thread-per-CPU foundation library used
by <a href="https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets">µWebSockets</a>.
It provides optimized networking - using the same opaque API
(programming interface) across all supported transports, event-loops and
platforms (QUIC is work-in-progress, so is io_uring).</p>

<h2 id="write-code-once">Write code once</h2>
<p>Based on µSockets, apps like µWebSockets can run on many platforms,
over many transports and with many event-loops - all without any code
changes or special execution paths. Moving data over TCP is just as easy
as over QUIC.</p>

<h2 id="lightweight-or-featureful">Lightweight or featureful</h2>
<p>In its minimal, TCP-only, configuration µSockets has no dependencies
other than the very OS kernel and compiles down to a tiny binary. In its
full configuration it depends on BoringSSL, lsquic and potentially some
event-loop library.</p>
<p>Here are some configurations; WITH_IO_URING, WITH_LIBUV, WITH_ASIO,
WITH_GCD, WITH_ASAN, WITH_QUIC, WITH_BORINGSSL, WITH_OPENSSL,
WITH_WOLFSSL.</p>

<p>µWebSockets itself is known to have run with outstanding performance
and stability since 2016. This thanks to, among other factors, the speed
and stability of µSockets. We fuzz and randomly “hammer test” the
library as part of security &amp; stability testing done in the
µWebSockets project.</p>
