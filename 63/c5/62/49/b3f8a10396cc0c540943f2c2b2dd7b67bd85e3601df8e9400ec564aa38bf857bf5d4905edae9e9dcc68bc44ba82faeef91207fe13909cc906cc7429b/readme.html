<p>To build on an Unixised setup: ./configure ; make ; make install if the ./configure file does not exist, run ./autogen.sh instead. To build on Windows: see instructions on win32/Readme.txt</p>
<p>To assert build quality: on an Unixised setup: run make tests otherwise: There is 3 standalone tools runtest.c runsuite.c testapi.c, which should compile as part of the build or as any application would. Launch them from this directory to get results, runtest checks the proper functionning of libxml2 main APIs while testapi does a full coverage check. Report failures to the list.</p>
