<p>This directory holds the Generic Security Service Library (GSSLib). See INSTALL for installation instructions, and doc/gss.{info,ps,pdf} for the manual.</p>
<p>Unless you want to use this library to implement a new GSS mechanism, you will need to first install Shishi, as it is the only supported mechanism right now. See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/shishi/" class="uri">http://www.gnu.org/software/shishi/</a></p>
<p>The GSS library (lib/) and test suite (tests/) are licensed under the GNU General Public License license version 3 or later (see COPYING), and the documentation (doc/) is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License version 1.3 or later.</p>
<p>The other sub-directories are included here for convenience, and are generated by other tools, or copied from other projects.</p>
