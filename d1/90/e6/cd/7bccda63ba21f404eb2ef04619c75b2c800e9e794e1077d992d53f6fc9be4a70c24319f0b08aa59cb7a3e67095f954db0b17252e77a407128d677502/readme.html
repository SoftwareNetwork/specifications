<h3 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>TINYUTF8 is a library for extremely easy integration of Unicode into an arbitrary C++11 project. The library consists solely of the class <code>utf8_string</code>, which acts as a drop-in replacement for <code>std::string</code>. Its implementation is successfully in the middle between small memory footprint and fast access.</p>
<h4 id="features">FEATURES</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drop-in replacement for std::string</strong></li>
<li><strong>Very Lightweight</strong> (~2.5K SLOC)</li>
<li><strong>Very fast</strong>, i.e. highly optimized decoder, encoder and traversal routines</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Memory Layout</strong>, i.e. Random Access is O( #Codepoints &gt; 127 ) for the average case</li>
<li><strong>Small String Optimization</strong> (SSO) for strings up to an UTF8-encoded length of <code>sizeof(utf8_string)</code>! That is, including the trailing <code>\0</code></li>
<li><strong>Growth in Constant Time</strong> (Amortized)</li>
<li><strong>Conversion between UTF32 and UTF8</strong></li>
<li>Small Stack Size, i.e. <code>sizeof(utf8_string)</code> = 16 Bytes (32Bit) / 32 Bytes (64Bit)</li>
<li>Codepoint Range of <code>0x0</code> - <code>0xFFFFFFFF</code>, i.e. 1-7 Code Units/Bytes per Codepoint (Note: This is more than specified by UTF8, but until now otherwise considered out of scope)</li>
<li>Single header file, single source file</li>
<li>Straightforward C++11 Design</li>
<li>Possibility to prepend the UTF8 BOM (Byte Order Mark) to any string when converting it to an std::string</li>
<li>Supports raw (Byte-based) access for occasions where Speed is needed.</li>
<li>Supports <code>shrink_to_fit()</code></li>
<li>Malformed UTF8 sequences will <strong>lead to defined behaviour</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-purpose-of-tinyutf8">THE PURPOSE OF TINYUTF8</h2>
<p>Back when I decided to write a UTF8 solution for C++, I knew I wanted a drop-in replacement for <code>std::string</code>. At the time mostly because I found it neat to have one and felt C++ always lacked accessible support for UTF8. Since then, several years have passed and the situation has not improved much. That said, things currently look like they are about to improve - but that doesn't say much, does it?</p>
<p>The opinion shared by many &quot;experienced Unicode programmers&quot; (e.g. published on <a href="utf8everywhere.org">UTF-8 Everywhere</a>) is that &quot;non-experienced&quot; programmers both <em>under</em> and <em>over</em>estimate the need for Unicode- and encoding-specific treatment: This need is... 1. <strong>overestimated</strong>, because many times we really should care less about codepoint/grapheme borders within string data; 2. <strong>underestimated</strong>, because if we really want to &quot;support&quot; unicode, we need to think about <em>normalizations</em>, <em>visual character comparisons</em>, <em>reserved codepoint values</em>, <em>illegal code unit sequences</em> and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Unicode is not rocket science but nonetheless hard to get <em>right</em>. TINYUTF8 does not intend to be an enterprise solution like <a href="http://site.icu-project.org/">ICU</a> for C++. The goal of TINYUTF8 is to - bridge as many gaps to &quot;supporting Unicode&quot; as possible by 'just' replacing <code>std::string</code> with a custom class which means to - provide you with a Codepoint Abstraction Layer that takes care of the Run-Length Encoding, without you noticing.</p>
<p>TINYUTF8 aims to be the simple-and-dependable groundwork which you build Unicode infrastructure upon. And, if <em>1)</em> C++2a should happen to make your Unicode life easier than TINYUTF8 or <em>2)</em> you decide to go enterprise, you have not wasted much time replacing <code>std::string</code> with <code>utf8_string</code> either. This is what makes TINYUTF8 so agreeable.</p>
<h4 id="what-tinyutf8-is-not-aimed-for">WHAT TINYUTF8 IS NOT AIMED FOR</h4>
<ul>
<li>Conversion between ISO encodings and UTF8</li>
<li>Interfacing with UTF16</li>
<li>Visible character comparison (<code>'ch'</code> vs. <code>'c'+'h'</code>)</li>
<li>Codepoint Normalization</li>
<li>Correct invalid Code Unit sequences</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: ANSI suppport was dropped in Version 2.0 in favor of execution speed.</p>
