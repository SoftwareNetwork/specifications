<p>Many Mesa devs hang on IRC; if you're not sure which channel is appropriate, you should ask your question on <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net#dri-devel">Freenode's #dri-devel</a>, someone will redirect you if necessary. Remember that not everyone is in the same timezone as you, so it might take a while before someone qualified sees your question. To figure out who you're talking to, or which nick to ping for your question, check out <a href="https://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/WhosWho/">Who's Who on IRC</a>.</p>
<p>The next best option is to ask your question in an email to the mailing lists: <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/mesa-dev">mesa-dev@lists.freedesktop.org</a></p>
