<p>This is flex, the fast lexical analyzer generator.</p>
<p>flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognize lexical patterns in text.</p>
<p>The flex codebase is kept in <a href="https://github.com/westes/flex">Git on GitHub.</a></p>
<p>Use GitHub's <a href="https://github.com/westes/flex/issues">issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/westes/flex">pull request</a> features to file bugs and submit patches.</p>
<p>There are several mailing lists available as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>flex-announce@lists.sourceforge.net - where posts will be made announcing new releases of flex.</li>
<li>flex-help@lists.sourceforge.net - where you can post questions about using flex</li>
<li>flex-devel@lists.sourceforge.net - where you can discuss development of flex itself</li>
</ul>

<p>The flex distribution contains the following files which may be of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>README - This file.</li>
<li>NEWS - current version number and list of user-visible changes.</li>
<li>INSTALL - basic installation information.</li>
<li>ABOUT-NLS - description of internationalization support in flex.</li>
<li>COPYING - flex's copyright and license.</li>
<li>doc/ - user documentation.</li>
<li>examples/ - containing examples of some possible flex scanners and a few other things. See the file examples/README for more details.</li>
<li>tests/ - regression tests. See TESTS/README for details.</li>
<li>po/ - internationalization support files.</li>
</ul>
<p>You need the following tools to build flex from the maintainer's repository:</p>
<ul>
<li>compiler suite - flex is built with gcc</li>
<li>bash, or a good Bourne-style shell</li>
<li>m4 - m4 -p needs to work; GNU m4 and a few others are suitable</li>
<li>GNU bison; to generate parse.c from parse.y</li>
<li>autoconf; for handling the build system</li>
<li>automake; for Makefile generation</li>
<li>gettext; for i18n support</li>
<li>help2man; to generate the flex man page</li>
<li>tar, gzip, lzip, etc.; for packaging of the source distribution</li>
<li>GNU texinfo; to build and test the flex manual. Note that if you want to build the dvi/ps/pdf versions of the documentation you will need texi2dvi and related programs, along with a sufficiently powerful implementation of TeX to process them. See your operating system documentation for how to achieve this. The printable versions of the manual are not built unless specifically requested, but the targets are included by automake.</li>
<li>GNU indent; for indenting the flex source the way we want it done</li>
</ul>
<p>In cases where the versions of the above tools matter, the file configure.ac will specify the minimum required versions.</p>
<p>Once you have all the necessary tools installed, life becomes simple. To prepare the flex tree for building, run the script:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">./autogen.sh</span></code></pre></div>
<p>in the top level of the flex source tree.</p>
<p>This script calls the various tools needed to get flex ready for the GNU-style configure script to be able to work.</p>
<p>From this point on, building flex follows the usual routine:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">configure</span> <span class="kw">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="fu">make</span> <span class="kw">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="fu">make</span> install</code></pre></div>
