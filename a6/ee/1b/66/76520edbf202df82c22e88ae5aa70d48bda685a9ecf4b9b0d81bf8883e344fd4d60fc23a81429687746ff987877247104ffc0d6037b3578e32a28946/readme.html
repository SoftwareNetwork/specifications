<p>The Multiprecision Library provides integer, rational, floating-point, complex and interval number types in C++ that have more range and precision than C++â€™s ordinary built-in types. The big number types in Multiprecision can be used with a wide selection of basic mathematical operations, elementary transcendental functions as well as the functions in Boost.Math. The Multiprecision types can also interoperate with the built-in types in C++ using clearly defined conversion rules. This allows Boost.Multiprecision to be used for all kinds of mathematical calculations involving integer, rational and floating-point types requiring extended range and precision.</p>
<p>Multiprecision consists of a generic interface to the mathematics of large numbers as well as a selection of big number back ends, with support for integer, rational and floating-point types. Boost.Multiprecision provides a selection of back ends provided off-the-rack in including interfaces to GMP, MPFR, MPIR, TomMath as well as its own collection of Boost-licensed, header-only back ends for integers, rationals, floats and complex. In addition, user-defined back ends can be created and used with the interface of Multiprecision, provided the class implementation adheres to the necessary concepts.</p>
<p>Depending upon the number type, precision may be arbitrarily large (limited only by available memory), fixed at compile time (for example 50 or 100 decimal digits), or a variable controlled at run-time by member functions. The types are expression-template-enabled for better performance than naive user-defined types.</p>

<h2 id="standalone-beta">Standalone (BETA)</h2>
<p>Defining BOOST_MP_STANDALONE allows Boost.Multiprecision to be used with the only dependency being <a href="https://github.com/boostorg/config">Boost.Config</a>. Our package on this page already includes a copy of Boost.Config so no other donwloads are required. Some functionality is reduced in this mode. A static_assert message will alert you if a particular feature has been disabled by standalone mode. <a href="https://github.com/boostorg/math">Boost.Math</a> standalone mode is compatiable, and recommended if special functions is required.</p>
<h2 id="support-bugs-and-feature-requests">Support, bugs and feature requests</h2>
<p>Bugs and feature requests can be reported through the <a href="https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/issues">Gitub issue tracker</a> (see <a href="https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/issues">open issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed">closed issues</a>).</p>
<p>You can submit your changes through a <a href="https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/pulls">pull request</a>.</p>
<p>There is no mailing-list specific to Boost Multiprecision, although you can use the general-purpose Boost <a href="http://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost-users">mailing-list</a> using the tag [multiprecision].</p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>Clone the whole boost project, which includes the individual Boost projects as submodules (<a href="https://github.com/boostorg/boost/wiki/Getting-Started">see boost+git doc</a>):</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/boostorg/boost
cd boost
git submodule update --init</code></pre>
<p>The Boost Multiprecision Library is located in <code>libs/multiprecision/</code>.</p>
<h3 id="running-tests">Running tests</h3>
<p>First, build the B2 engine by running <code>bootstrap.sh</code> in the root of the boost directory. This will generate B2 configuration in <code>project-config.jam</code>.</p>
<pre><code>./bootstrap.sh</code></pre>
<p>Now make sure you are in <code>libs/multiprecision/test</code>. You can either run all the tests listed in <code>Jamfile.v2</code> or run a single test:</p>
<pre><code>../../../b2                        &lt;- run all tests
../../../b2 test_complex           &lt;- single test</code></pre>
