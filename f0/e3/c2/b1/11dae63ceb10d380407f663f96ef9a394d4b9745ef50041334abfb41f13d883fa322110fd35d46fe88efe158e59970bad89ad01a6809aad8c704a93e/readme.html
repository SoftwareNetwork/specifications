<h2 id="apache-portable-runtime-utility-library-readme">Apache Portable Runtime Utility Library README</h2>
<p>The Apache Portable Runtime Utility Library provides a predictable and consistent interface to underlying client library interfaces. This API assures predictable if not identical behavior regardless of which libraries are available on a given platform.</p>
<p>APR and its companion libraries are implemented entirely in C and provide a common programming interface across a wide variety of operating system platforms without sacrificing performance. Currently supported platforms include:</p>
<pre><code> UNIX variants
 Windows
 Netware
 Mac OS X
 OS/2</code></pre>
<p>To give a brief overview, the primary core subsystems of APR-util 1.3 include the following:</p>
<pre><code> Hashing and UUID services
 Multiple SQL DBD client interfaces
 Multiple flat-database DBM client interfaces
 Typesafe function Hooks abstraction
 LDAP SSL connections for a variety of LDAP toolkits   
 MemCache interface
 Date parsing rourtines
 Resource Lists
 Thread Pools
 Queues
 Relocatable Memory Management functions
 String filename-style pattern matching
 URI Parsing
 Charset translation (iconv based)
 XML parsing (expat)</code></pre>
<p>For a more complete list, please refer to the following URLs:</p>
<pre><code> http://apr.apache.org/docs/apr-util/modules.html</code></pre>
<p>Users of APR 0.9 should be aware that migrating to the APR 1.x programming interfaces may require some adjustments; APR 1.x is neither source nor binary compatible with earlier APR 0.9 releases. Users of APR 1.x can expect consistent interfaces and binary backwards compatibility throughout the entire APR 1.x release cycle, as defined in our versioning rules:</p>
<pre><code> http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html</code></pre>
<p>APR is already used extensively by the Apache HTTP Server version 2 and the Subversion revision control system, to name but a few. We list all known projects using APR at http://apr.apache.org/projects.html -- so please let us know if you find our libraries useful in your own projects!</p>
<h2 id="database-providers">Database Providers</h2>
<p>As of apr-util version 1.2.11, MySQL DBD driver is shipped as part of the distribution. However, to avoid licensing incompatibilities, it is not built by default. To enable MySQL support, use the --with-mysql option, but be aware that the MySQL license may introduce licensing implications for your compiled code. Similarly, the bindings for propritary drivers such as Oracle (--with-oracle option) must also be explicitly enabled.</p>
<p>On windows, selection of supported drivers is via the environment values DBD_LIST (for mysql, oracle, pgsql, sqlite2 and/or sqlite3) and DBM_LIST (db and/or gdbm). DBD odbc and DBM sdbm are unconditionally compiled and installed, do not include these in the list.</p>
<p>Whenever distributing apr-util in combination with database client drivers, always review the license requirements of all components.</p>
<h2 id="cryptographic-software-notice">Cryptographic Software Notice</h2>
<p>This distribution includes cryptographic software. The country in which you currently reside may have restrictions on the import, possession, use, and/or re-export to another country, of encryption software. BEFORE using any encryption software, please check your country's laws, regulations and policies concerning the import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software, to see if this is permitted. See http://www.wassenaar.org/ for more information.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), has classified this software as Export Commodity Control Number (ECCN) 5D002.C.1, which includes information security software using or performing cryptographic functions with asymmetric algorithms. The form and manner of this Apache Software Foundation distribution makes it eligible for export under the License Exception ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception (see the BIS Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13) for both object code and source code.</p>
<p>The following provides more details on the included cryptographic software:</p>
<p>APR-Util provides an abstract interface for symmetrical cryptographic functions that make use of a general-purpose encryption library, such as OpenSSL, NSS, or the operating system's platform-specific facilities. This interface is known as the apr_crypto interface, with implementation beneath the /crypto directory.</p>
<p>APR-Util provides an abstract interface for SSL encrypted LDAP (ldaps and STARTTLS style) connections, which can be powered by OpenLDAP, Netscape LDAP SDK, Mozilla LDAP SDK, or other platform specific ldap interfaces.</p>
