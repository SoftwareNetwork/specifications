<h1 id="what-this-repo-is-useful-for">What This Repo Is Useful For</h1>
<p>If you’re a programmer who just wants to use the STL, you
<strong>don’t</strong> need this repo. Simply install the Visual Studio
IDE and select the “Desktop development with C++” workload.</p>
<p>If you want to participate in the STL’s development, welcome! You can
report issues, comment on pull requests, and learn about what we’re
working on. You can also submit pull requests to fix bugs or add
features: see <a href="CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a> for more
information.</p>
<p>Finally, you can take our code and use it in other apps and libraries
(according to the terms of our license, like everything else).</p>
<h1 id="github-migration-status">GitHub Migration Status</h1>
<p>We’re in the process of moving all of our work on the STL to GitHub.
Current status:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Code: <strong>Done.</strong> Our source code is available under
the Apache License v2.0 with LLVM Exception. (See <a
href="LICENSE.txt">LICENSE.txt</a> and <a
href="NOTICE.txt">NOTICE.txt</a> for more information.)</p></li>
<li><p>Build System: <strong>In progress.</strong> We’re working on a
CMake build system, which is currently capable of building one flavor of
the STL (native desktop). We need to extend this to build all of the
flavors required for the MSVC toolset (e.g. <code>/clr</code>,
<code>/clr:pure</code>, OneCore, Spectre). Until that’s done, we’re
keeping our legacy build system around in the <code>stl/msbuild</code>
subdirectory. (We’re keeping those files in this repo, even though
they’re unusable outside of Microsoft, because they need to be updated
whenever source files are added/renamed/deleted. We’ll delete the legacy
machinery as soon as possible.)</p></li>
<li><p>Tests: <strong>In progress.</strong> We rely on three test
suites: std, tr1, and <a href="https://libcxx.llvm.org">libcxx</a>.
We’ve partially ported std and tr1, and fully ported libcxx to run under
<a href="https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/lit.html">lit</a> using the
various configurations/compilers we test internally.</p></li>
<li><p>Continuous Integration: <strong>In progress.</strong> We’ve set
up Azure Pipelines to validate changes to the repository. Currently, it
builds the STL (native desktop for x86, x64, ARM, and ARM64). Also, it
strictly verifies that all of our files have been formatted with <a
href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html">clang-format</a> and
follow our other whitespace conventions.</p></li>
<li><p>Contribution Guidelines: <strong>Coming soon.</strong> Working on
the STL’s code involves following many rules. We have codebase
conventions, Standard requirements, Microsoft-specific requirements,
binary compatibility (ABI) requirements, and more. We’re eager to begin
accepting features and fixes from the community, but in addition to
setting up a CI system, we need to write down all of the rules that are
currently stored in our brains. (The ABI rules may be useful to other
C++ libraries.)</p></li>
<li><p>Issues: <strong>In progress.</strong> We’re going to use GitHub
issues to track all of the things that we need to work on. This includes
C++20 features, <a
href="https://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/lwg-toc.html">LWG issues</a>,
conformance bugs, performance improvements, and other todos. There are
approximately 200 active bugs in the STL’s Microsoft-internal database;
we need to manually replicate all of them to GitHub issues. Currently,
the <a
href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Acxx20">cxx20
tag</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ALWG">LWG
tag</a> are done; every remaining work item is tracked by a GitHub
issue. The <a
href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug">bug
tag</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement">enhancement
tag</a> are being populated.</p></li>
<li><p>Plans: <strong>In progress.</strong> We’re writing up our <a
href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/wiki/Roadmap">Roadmap</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="goals">Goals</h1>
<p>We’re implementing the latest C++ Working Draft, currently <a
href="https://wg21.link/N5001">N5001</a>, which will eventually become
the next C++ International Standard. The terms Working Draft (WD) and
Working Paper (WP) are interchangeable; we often informally refer to
these drafts as “the Standard” while being aware of the difference.
(There are other relevant Standards; for example, supporting
<code>/std:c++14</code> and <code>/std:c++17</code> involves
understanding how the C++14 and C++17 Standards differ from the Working
Paper, and we often need to refer to the C Standard Library and
ECMAScript regular expression specifications.)</p>
<p>Our primary goals are conformance, performance, usability, and
compatibility.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conformance: The Working Paper is a moving target; as features
and LWG issue resolutions are added, we need to implement them. That can
involve a lot of work because the STL is required to behave in very
specific ways and to handle users doing very unusual things.</p></li>
<li><p>Performance: The STL needs to be extremely fast at runtime; speed
is one of C++’s core strengths and most C++ programs use the STL
extensively. As a result, we spend more time on optimization than most
general-purpose libraries. (However, we’re wary of changes that improve
some scenarios at the expense of others, or changes that make code
significantly more complicated and fragile. That is, there’s a
“complexity budget” that must be spent carefully.)</p></li>
<li><p>Usability: This includes parts of the programming experience like
compiler throughput, diagnostic messages, and debugging checks. For
example, we’ve extensively marked the STL with
<code>[[nodiscard]]</code> attributes because this helps programmers
avoid bugs.</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibility: This includes binary compatibility and source
compatibility. We’re keeping VS 2022 binary-compatible with VS
2015/2017/2019, which restricts what we can change in VS 2022 updates.
(We’ve found that significant changes are possible even though other
changes are impossible, which we’ll be documenting in our Contribution
Guidelines soon.) While there are a few exceptions to this rule (e.g. if
a feature is added to the Working Paper, we implement it, and then the
feature is significantly changed before the International Standard is
finalized, we reserve the right to break binary compatibility because
<code>/std:c++latest</code> offers an experimental preview of such
features), binary compatibility generally overrides all other
considerations, even conformance. Source compatibility refers to being
able to successfully recompile user code without changes. We consider
source compatibility to be important, but not all-important; breaking
source compatibility can be an acceptable cost if done for the right
reasons in the right way (e.g. in a controlled manner with escape
hatches).</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="non-goals">Non-Goals</h1>
<p>There are things that we aren’t interested in doing with this
project, for various reasons (most importantly, we need to focus
development effort on our goals). Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Non-goal: Porting to other platforms.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-goal: Adding non-Standard extensions.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-goal: Implementing Technical Specifications. (We’re
prioritizing features in the Working Paper. Occasionally, we might
implement some or all of a TS, often when we’re working on the
specification itself.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re proposing a feature to WG21 (the C++ Standardization
Committee), you’re welcome (and encouraged!) to use our code as a base
for a proof-of-concept implementation. These non-goals simply mean that
we’re unable to consider pull requests for a proposed feature until it
has been voted into a Working Paper. After that happens, we’ll be
delighted to review a production-ready pull request.</p>
<h1 id="reporting-issues">Reporting Issues</h1>
<p>You can report STL bugs here, where they’ll be directly reviewed by
maintainers. You can also report STL bugs through <a
href="https://aka.ms/feedback/report?space=62">Developer Community</a>,
or the VS IDE (Help &gt; Send Feedback &gt; Report a Problem…).</p>
<p><strong>Please help us</strong> efficiently process bug reports by
following these rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Only STL bugs should be reported here. If it’s a bug in the
compiler, CRT, or IDE, please report it through Developer Community or
Report A Problem. If it’s a bug in the Windows SDK, please report it
through the <a
href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub-app">Feedback
Hub</a> app. If you aren’t sure, try to reduce your test case and see if
you can eliminate the STL’s involvement while still reproducing the
bug.</p></li>
<li><p>You should be reasonably confident that you’re looking at an
actual implementation bug, instead of undefined behavior or
surprising-yet-Standard behavior. Comparing against other
implementations can help (but remember that implementations can differ
while conforming to the Standard); try <a
href="https://godbolt.org">Compiler Explorer</a>. If you still aren’t
sure, ask the nearest C++ expert.</p></li>
<li><p>You should prepare a self-contained command-line test case,
ideally as small as possible. We need a source file, a command line,
what happened (e.g. a compiler error, runtime misbehavior), and what you
expected to happen. By “self-contained”, we mean that your source file
has to avoid including code that we don’t have. Ideally, only CRT and
STL headers should be included. If you have to include other MSVC
libraries, or the Windows SDK, to trigger an STL bug, that’s okay. But
if you need parts of your own source code to trigger the STL bug, you
need to extract that for us. (On Developer Community, we’ll accept
zipped IDE projects if you have no other way to reproduce a bug, but
this is very time-consuming for us to reduce.)</p></li>
<li><p>A good title is helpful. We prefer
“<code>&lt;header_name&gt;</code>: Short description of your issue”. You
don’t usually need to mention <code>std::</code> or C++. For example,
“<code>&lt;type_traits&gt;</code>: <code>is_cute</code> should be true
for <code>enum class FluffyKittens</code>”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s okay if you report an apparent STL bug that turns out to be a
compiler bug or surprising-yet-Standard behavior. Just try to follow
these rules, so we can spend more time fixing bugs and implementing
features.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-consume">How To Consume</h1>
<p>Consumption of the built library is largely based on the build system
you’re using. There are at least 2 directories you need to hook up.
Assuming you built the x64 target with the Visual Studio IDE, with the
STL repository cloned to <code>C:\Dev\STL</code>, build outputs will end
up at <code>C:\Dev\STL\out\x64\out</code>. Ensure that the
<code>inc</code> directory is searched for headers, and that
<code>lib\{architecture}</code> is searched for link libraries, before
any defaults supplied by MSVC. The names of the import and static
libraries are the same as those that ship with MSVC. As a result, the
compiler <code>/MD</code>, <code>/MDd</code>, <code>/MT</code>, or
<code>/MTd</code> switches will work without modification of your build
scripts or command-line muscle memory.</p>
<p>Should you choose to use the DLL flavors, the DLLs to deploy are
built to <code>bin\{architecture}</code>. Note that the DLLs generated
by the CMake build system here have a suffix, defaulting to
<code>_oss</code>, which distinguishes them from the binaries that ship
with MSVC. That avoids any conflict with the DLLs installed by the <a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist">redistributables</a>
into System32 and ensures that other components wanting to be a “guest
in your process”, like print drivers and shell extensions, see the
export surface of the STL they were built with. Otherwise, the
“<code>msvcp140.dll</code>” you deployed in the same directory as your
.exe would “win” over the versions in System32.</p>
<p>The compiler looks for include directories according to the
<code>INCLUDE</code> environment variable, and the linker looks for
import library directories according to the <code>LIB</code> environment
variable, and the Windows loader will (eventually) look for DLL
dependencies according to directories in the <code>PATH</code>
environment variable. The build generates a batch script named
<code>set_environment.bat</code> in the output directory. If you run
this script in a VS Developer Command Prompt, it will insert the proper
directories into the <code>INCLUDE</code>, <code>LIB</code>, and
<code>PATH</code> environment variables to ensure that the built headers
and libraries are used.</p>

</ul></li>

</ol>
<h2 id="running-the-tests">Running The Tests</h2>
<p>Our tests are currently split across three test suites that are
located at <code>tests\std</code>, <code>tests\tr1</code>, and
<code>llvm-project\libcxx\test\std</code>. The test runner
<code>${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}\tests\utils\stl-lit\stl-lit.py</code>
accepts paths to directories in the test suites and runs all tests
located in the subtree rooted at those paths. This can mean executing
the entirety of a single test suite, running all tests under a category
in <code>libcxx</code>, or running a single test in <code>std</code> and
<code>tr1</code>.</p>
<p>Some useful <code>stl-lit.py</code> options: * <code>-v</code>
(verbose) tells <code>stl-lit.py</code> to show us output from failed
test cases. * <code>-Dnotags=ASAN</code> disables the “extra ASan
configs” that we typically run only in CI. This is useful to limit
runtime for full validation runs, but often omitted when running just a
few test cases to enable the extra ASan coverage.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>These examples assume that your current directory is
<code>C:\Dev\STL\out\x64</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>This command will run all of the test suites:
<ul>
<li><code>python tests\utils\stl-lit\stl-lit.py -Dnotags=ASAN ..\..\llvm-project\libcxx\test ..\..\tests\std ..\..\tests\tr1</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>This command will run only the std test suite.
<ul>
<li><code>python tests\utils\stl-lit\stl-lit.py -Dnotags=ASAN ..\..\tests\std</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you want to run a subset of a test suite, you need to point it to
the right place in the sources. The following will run the single test
found under <code>VSO_0000000_any_calling_conventions</code>.
<ul>
<li><code>python tests\utils\stl-lit\stl-lit.py -Dnotags=ASAN ..\..\tests\std\tests\VSO_0000000_any_calling_conventions</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can invoke <code>stl-lit</code> with any arbitrary subdirectory
of a test suite. In libcxx this allows you to have finer control over
what category of tests you would like to run. The following will run all
the libcxx map tests.
<ul>
<li><code>python tests\utils\stl-lit\stl-lit.py -Dnotags=ASAN ..\..\llvm-project\libcxx\test\std\containers\associative\map</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can also use the <code>--filter</code> option to include tests
whose names match a regular expression. The following command will run
tests with “atomic_wait” in their names in both the std and libcxx test
suites.
<ul>
<li><code>python tests\utils\stl-lit\stl-lit.py ..\..\llvm-project\libcxx\test ..\..\tests\std --filter=atomic_wait</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>There’s also a <code>--filter-out</code> option to exclude tests
matching a regular expression;
<code>--filter=iota --filter-out=view</code> would run tests with names
matching “iota” but not “view”.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="interpreting-the-results-of-tests">Interpreting The Results Of
Tests</h2>
<p><code>stl-lit.py</code> prints the result of each test. The format of
each result is
<code>{Result Code}: {Test Suite Name} :: {Test Name}:{Configuration Number}</code>.</p>

For our tests, only the <code>PASS</code>, <code>XFAIL</code>,
<code>XPASS</code>, <code>FAIL</code>, <code>UNSUPPORTED</code>, and
<code>SKIPPED</code> result codes are relevant.</p>
<p>The <code>PASS</code> and <code>FAIL</code> result codes are
self-explanatory. We want our tests to <code>PASS</code> and not
<code>FAIL</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>XPASS</code> and <code>XFAIL</code> result codes are less
obvious. <code>XPASS</code> is actually a failure result and indicates
that we expected a test to fail but it passed. <code>XFAIL</code> is a
successful result and indicates that we expected the test to fail and it
did. Typically an <code>XPASS</code> result means that the
<code>expected_results.txt</code> file for the test suite needs to be
modified. If the <code>XPASS</code> result is a test legitimately
passing, the usual course of action would be to remove a
<code>FAIL</code> entry from the <code>expected_results.txt</code>.
However, some tests from <code>libcxx</code> mark themselves as
<code>XFAIL</code> (meaning they expect to fail) for features they have
added tests for but have yet to implement in <code>libcxx</code>. If the
STL implements those features first the tests will begin passing
unexpectedly for us and return <code>XPASS</code> results. In order to
resolve this it is necessary to add a <code>PASS</code> entry to the
<code>expected_results.txt</code> of the test suite in question.</p>
<p>The <code>UNSUPPORTED</code> result code means that the requirements
for a test are not met and so it will not be run. Currently, all tests
which use the <code>/clr</code> or <code>/clr:pure</code> options are
unsupported. Also, the <code>/BE</code> option is unsupported for
x86.</p>
<p>The <code>SKIPPED</code> result code indicates that a given test was
explicitly skipped by adding a <code>SKIPPED</code> entry to the
<code>expected_results.txt</code>. A test may be skipped for a number of
reasons, which include, but are not limited to: * being an incorrect
test * taking a very long time to run * failing or passing for the
incorrect reason</p>
<h3 id="debugging-individual-tests">Debugging Individual Tests</h3>
<p>While <code>stl-lit</code> is super awesome in finding out that
<em>something</em> is wrong or not even compiling, it is not really
helpful in debugging <em>what</em> is going wrong. However, debugging
individual tests is rather simple given some additional steps. Let’s
assume we want to debug a new feature with tests located in
<code>tests\std\tests\GH_XXXX_meow</code>.</p>
<p>As always, build the STL from your branch and run the tests:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Dev\STL\out\x64&gt; ninja
C:\Dev\STL\out\x64&gt; python tests\utils\stl-lit\stl-lit.py -v C:\Dev\STL\tests\std\tests\GH_XXXX_meow</code></pre>
<p>Let’s assume one of the tests fails an assert and we want to debug
that configuration. <code>stl-lit</code> will conveniently print the
build command, which is far too long to provide here in full. The
important part is to add the following options to provide debug symbols:
<code>/Zi /Fdbark.pdb</code>.</p>
<p>You can replace <code>bark</code> with any descriptive name you like.
Add these before the <code>"-link"</code> option in the command line and
recompile. Example:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Dev\STL\out\x64&gt;cl &quot;C:\Dev\STL\tests\std\tests\GH_XXXX_meow\test.cpp&quot; [... more arguments ...]
&quot;-FeC:\Dev\STL\out\x64\tests\std\tests\GH_XXXX_meow\Output\02\GH_XXXX_meow.exe&quot; /Zi /Fdbark.pdb &quot;-link&quot;
[... more arguments ...]</code></pre>
<p>You can now start debugging the test via:</p>
<pre><code>devenv &quot;C:\Dev\STL\out\x64\tests\std\tests\GH_XXXX_meow\Output\02\GH_XXXX_meow.exe&quot;
       &quot;C:\Dev\STL\tests\std\tests\GH_XXXX_meow\test.cpp&quot;</code></pre>
<p>However, this might not work right away, as Visual Studio may
complain about a missing <code>msvcp140_oss.dll</code>. The reason is
that the STL builds those and other DLLs itself and we should under no
circumstances overwrite the installed ones. If you are testing one of
the configurations with dynamic linkage (<code>/MD</code> or
<code>/MDd</code>) the easiest solution is to add the build folder to
your path:</p>
<pre><code>set PATH=C:\Dev\STL\out\x64\out\bin\amd64;%PATH%</code></pre>
<h2 id="running-tests-with-address-sanitizer-asan">Running Tests With
Address Sanitizer (ASan)</h2>
<p>You don’t need any extra steps to run with test code and the code in
STL headers instrumented with <a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/sanitizers/asan">ASan</a>.
The test matrices include both ASan and non-ASan configurations if you
don’t pass <code>-Dtags=ASAN</code> or <code>-Dnotags=ASAN</code> to
exclude one or the other.</p>
<p>However, to instrument the separately-compiled code (the DLL, the
satellites, the <a href="/docs/import_library.md">Import Library</a> -
everything that’s in <code>/stl/src</code>), you need to build the STL
with ASan. Change the build steps to add
<code>-DSTL_ASAN_BUILD=ON</code>:</p>
<pre><code>cmake --preset x64 -DSTL_ASAN_BUILD=ON
cmake --build --preset x64</code></pre>
<p>ASan-instrumented STL binaries require that the executable be
instrumented as well, so you’ll have to skip the non-ASan configurations
by passing <code>-Dtags=ASAN</code> to <code>stl-lit.py</code>:</p>
<p>(This example assumes that your current directory is
<code>C:\Dev\STL\out\x64</code>.)</p>
<pre><code>python tests\utils\stl-lit\stl-lit.py ..\..\tests\std\tests\VSO_0000000_vector_algorithms -Dtags=ASAN -v</code></pre>
<h1 id="benchmarking">Benchmarking</h1>
<p>For performance-sensitive code – containers, algorithms, and the like
– you may wish to write and/or run benchmarks, and the STL team will
likely run any benchmarks we do have in our PR process. Additionally, if
you are writing a “performance improvement” PR, please add and run
benchmarks to show that the PR does, in fact, improve performance.</p>
<p>The benchmarking code is located in <code>benchmarks</code>. Adding a
new benchmark is as easy as adding a new file to
<code>benchmarks/src</code>, and then adding
<code>add_benchmark(&lt;name&gt; &lt;source_file&gt;)</code> to
<code>benchmarks/CMakeLists.txt</code>. You may also modify an existing
benchmark file. We use Google’s <a
href="https://github.com/google/benchmark">Benchmark</a> library, so you
may find <a
href="https://github.com/google/benchmark/blob/main/docs/user_guide.md">their
documentation</a> helpful, and you can also read the existing code for
how <em>we</em> use it.</p>
<p>To run benchmarks, you’ll need to first build the STL, then build the
benchmarks:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre
class="sourceCode cmd"><code class="sourceCode dosbat"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>cmake -<span class="at">-preset</span> x64</span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>cmake -<span class="at">-build</span> -<span class="at">-preset</span> x64</span>

<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>cmake -<span class="at">-build</span> out\bench</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can then run your benchmark with:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre
class="sourceCode cmd"><code class="sourceCode dosbat"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>out\bench\benchmark-<span class="kw">&lt;</span>benchmark-name<span class="kw">&gt;</span> --benchmark_out=<span class="kw">&lt;</span>file<span class="kw">&gt;</span> --benchmark_out_format=csv</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then you can copy this CSV file into Excel, or another
spreadsheet program. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre
class="sourceCode cmd"><code class="sourceCode dosbat"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>out\bench\benchmark-std_copy -<span class="at">-benchmark_out</span>=benchmark<span class="at">-std_copy-results</span>.csv -<span class="at">-benchmark_out_format</span>=csv</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you want to see all the other flags you can pass, run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre
class="sourceCode cmd"><code class="sourceCode dosbat"><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>out\bench\benchmark-<span class="kw">&lt;</span>benchmark-name<span class="kw">&gt;</span> --help</span></code></pre></div>
