<h1 id="pcre2---perl-compatible-regular-expressions">PCRE2 -
Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions</h1>
<p>The PCRE2 library is a set of C functions that implement regular
expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl
5. PCRE2 has its own native API, as well as a set of wrapper functions
that correspond to the POSIX regular expression API. The PCRE2 library
is free, even for building proprietary software. It comes in three
forms, for processing 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit code units, in either
literal or UTF encoding.</p>
<p>PCRE2 was first released in 2015 to replace the API in the original
PCRE library, which is now obsolete and no longer maintained. As well as
a more flexible API, the code of PCRE2 has been much improved since the
fork.</p>
