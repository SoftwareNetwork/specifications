<p>README:</p>
<p>This is GNU Awk 5.3.0. It is upwardly compatible with Brian
Kernighan’s version of Unix awk. It is almost completely compliant with
the 2018 POSIX 1003.1 standard for awk. (See the note below about
POSIX.)</p>
<p>This is a major release. See NEWS and ChangeLog for details.</p>
<p>Work to be done is described briefly in the TODO file, which is
available only in the ‘master’ branch in the Git repo.</p>
<p>Changes in this version are summarized in the NEWS file.</p>
<p>Read the file POSIX.STD for a discussion of issues where the standard
says one thing but gawk does something different.</p>
<p>To format the documentation with TeX, use at least version
2023-09-19.19 of texinfo.tex. There is a usable copy of texinfo.tex in
the doc directory. You must also use at least version 7.1 of texindex
and of makeinfo from the texinfo-7.1 distribution.</p>
<p>INSTALLATION:</p>
<p>Check whether there is a system-specific README file for your system
under the `README_d’ directory. If there’s something there that you
should have read and didn’t, and you bug me about it, I’m going to yell
at you.</p>
<p>See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.</p>
<p>If you don’t have Bison, use the awkgram.c file here. It was
generated with Bison, and has no proprietary code in it. (Note that
modifying awkgram.y without Bison is next to impossible. You might want
to get a copy of Bison from the FSF too.)</p>
<p>The build mechanics depend upon Bison. Also, gawk doesn’t work
correctly with some versions of yacc, so just use Bison.</p>
<p>If you have an MS-DOS, or MS-Windows system, use the stuff in the
`pc’ directory. Similarly, there is a separate directory for VMS.</p>
<p>Appendix B of ``GAWK: Effective Awk Programming’’ discusses
configuration in detail. The configuration process is based on GNU
Autoconf and Automake.</p>
<p>After successful compilation, do
<code>make check' to run the test suite. There should be no output from the</code>cmp’
invocations except in the cases where there are small differences in
floating point values, and possibly in the case of strftime. There may
be differences based on installed (or not installed) locales and the
quality of multibyte character support on your system.</p>
<p>Several of the tests ignore errors on purpose; those are not a
problem. If there are other differences, please investigate and report
the problem.</p>
<p>PRINTING THE MANUAL</p>
<p>The
<code>doc' directory contains a recent version of texinfo.tex, which will be necessary for printing the manual.  Use</code>make
dvi’ to get a DVI file from the manual. In the
<code>doc' directory, use</code>make postscript’ to get PostScript
versions of the manual, the man page, and the reference card. Use `make
pdf’ to get PDF versions of the manuals, the man page and the reference
card.</p>
<p>BUG REPORTS AND FIXES (Un*x systems):</p>
<p>Please coordinate changes through Arnold Robbins. In particular, see
the section in the manual on reporting bugs. Note that comp.lang.awk is
about the worst place to post a gawk bug report. So too is use of a web
forum such as Stack Overflow. Please, use the mechanisms outlined in the
manual.</p>
<p>Bug reports should be submitted using the `gawkbug’ script. This
formats a report and sends it to bug-gawk@gnu.org. This is a separate
mailing list at GNU Central. The advantage to using this address is that
bug reports are archived at GNU Central.</p>
<p>General non-bug questions should be sent to help-gawk@gnu.org.</p>
