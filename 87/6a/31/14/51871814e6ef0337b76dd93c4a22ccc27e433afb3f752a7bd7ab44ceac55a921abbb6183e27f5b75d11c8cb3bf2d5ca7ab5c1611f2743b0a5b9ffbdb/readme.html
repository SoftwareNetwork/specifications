<p>Cairo - Multi-platform 2D graphics library https://cairographics.org</p>
<h1 id="what-is-cairo">What is cairo</h1>
<p>Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output devices. Currently supported output targets include the X Window System (via both Xlib and XCB), quartz, win32, and image buffers, as well as PDF, PostScript, and SVG file output. Experimental backends include OpenGL.</p>
<p>Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output media while taking advantage of display hardware acceleration when available (for example, through the X Render Extension).</p>
<p>The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators of PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo include stroking and filling cubic Bézier splines, transforming and compositing translucent images, and antialiased text rendering. All drawing operations can be transformed by any affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear, etc.).</p>
<p>Cairo has been designed to let you draw anything you want in a modern 2D graphical user interface. At the same time, the cairo API has been designed to be as fun and easy to learn as possible. If you’re not having fun while programming with cairo, then we have failed somewhere—let us know and we’ll try to fix it next time around.</p>
<p>Cairo is free software and is available to be redistributed and/or modified under the terms of either the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 or the Mozilla Public License (MPL) version 1.1.</p>

<h1 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h1>
<p>The set of libraries needed to compile cairo depends on which backends are enabled when cairo is configured. So look at the list below to determine which dependencies are needed for the backends of interest.</p>
<p>For the surface backends, we have both “supported” and “experimental” backends. Further, the supported backends can be divided into the “standard” backends which can be easily built on any platform, and the “platform” backends which depend on some underlying platform-specific system, (such as the X Window System or some other window system).</p>
<p>As an example, for a standard Linux build similar to what’s shipped by your distro, (with image, png, pdf, PostScript, svg, and xlib surface backends, and the freetype font backend), the following sample commands will install necessary dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>Debian (and similar):

apt-get build-dep cairo

Fedora (and similar):

yum install libpng-devel zlib-devel libXrender-devel fontconfig-devel</code></pre>
<p>Technically you probably don’t need pixman from the distribution since if you’re manually compiling Cairo you probably want an updated pixman as well. However, if you follow the default settings and install pixman to /usr/local, your Cairo build should properly use it in preference to the system pixman.</p>

XCB         https://xcb.freedesktop.org</code></pre>
<h2 id="font-backends-required-to-have-at-least-one">Font backends (required to have at least one)</h2>
<pre><code>freetype font backend
---------------------
freetype &gt;= 2.1.9   http://freetype.org
fontconfig      http://fontconfig.org

quartz-font backend
-------------------
MacOS X &gt;= 10.4 with Xcode &gt;= 2.4

win32 font backend
------------------
Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer[*].

[*] The Win32 backend should work on Windows 2000 and newer
    (excluding Windows Me.) Most testing has been done on
    Windows XP. While some portions of the code have been
    adapted to work on older versions of Windows, considerable
    work still needs to be done to get cairo running in those
    environments.

    Cairo can be compiled on Windows with either the gcc
    toolchain (see http://www.mingw.org) or with Microsoft
    Visual C++.  If the gcc toolchain is used, the standard
    build instructions using configure apply, (see INSTALL).
    If Visual C++ is desired, GNU make is required and
    Makefile.win32 can be used via &#39;make -f Makefile.win32&#39;.
    The compiler, include paths, and library paths must be set
    up correctly in the environment.

    MSVC versions earlier than 7.1 are known to miscompile
    parts of cairo and pixman, and so should be avoided. MSVC
    7.1 or later, including the free Microsoft Visual Studio
    Express editions, produce correct code.</code></pre>

<h1 id="history">History</h1>
<p>Cairo was originally developed by Carl Worth <a href="mailto:cworth@cworth.org" class="email">cworth@cworth.org</a> and Keith Packard <a href="mailto:keithp@keithp.com" class="email">keithp@keithp.com</a>. Many thanks are due to Lyle Ramshaw without whose patient help our ignorance would be much more apparent.</p>
<p>Since the original development, many more people have contributed to cairo. See the AUTHORS files for as complete a list as we’ve been able to compile so far.</p>
