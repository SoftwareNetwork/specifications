<h3 id="jpeg-xr-format">JPEG XR Format</h3>
<p>JPEG XR is a still image format based on technology originally developed by Mirosoft under the name HD Photo (formerly Windows Media™ Photo). The JPEG XR format is similar, but not identical, to the HD Photo/Windows Media™ Photo format.</p>
<p>The JPEG XR format replaces the HD Photo/Windows Media™ Photo format in both Windows 8 and the Windows Image Component (WIC). WIC accompanies the Internet Explorer 10 redistributable packages for down-level versions of Windows. Some “Windows Media™ Photo” (WMP) naming conventions are still used internally with this release of the DPK.</p>
<p>JPEG XR files use the .jxr extension. Applications that support the JPEG XR file format should recognize and decode HD Photo/Windows Media™ Photo .hdp/.wdp files, but only offer to create files with the .jxr extension.</p>
<h3 id="jpeg-xr-image-coding-specification">JPEG XR Image Coding Specification</h3>
<p>The JPEG XR Image Coding Spectification provides a detailed specification of the compression encoder and decoder algorithms plus the detailed structure of the compressed data (elementary) bit stream. This document is designed to be used in conjunction with the included source code. If you find instances where the code differs from the documentation, the code implementation should be used as the reference.</p>
<p>The JPEG XR Image Coding Spectification is an international standard and is available at: http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.832 while the reference software is available at: http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.835.</p>
<h3 id="status-of-jpeg-xr-implementation">Status of JPEG XR implementation</h3>
<p>&quot;JPEGXR_DPK_1.0.doc&quot; documents the contents of this porting kit, the usage of the command line file conversion utilities (JXREncApp.exe and JXRDecApp.exe), and technical details of the API's and data structures between these sample command line applications and the core codec.</p>
<p>The code and documentation in this release represent the final design and specification of the 1.0 bit stream, and can be used as the reference for final implementations of encoders and decoders for JPEG XR.</p>
<p>This release of the DPK has received extensive testing of all the various pixel formats, encoder options and modes of operation. We are confident that most errors and other bugs have been resolved. Any code bugs, documentation errors or other discrepancies found in this release candidate should be reported to Microsoft as promptly as possible. These can be submitted to hdview@microsoft.com.</p>
<p>This DPK provides basic support for big endian architectures. We have successfully tested the encoder and decoder using a big endian processor. This support is provided as a starting reference to be adapted to the specific platform and hardware architecture of the target system.</p>
