<p>This is the git repository for <a href="http://www.libtom.net/LibTomMath/">LibTomMath</a>, a free open source portable number theoretic multiple-precision integer (MPI) library written entirely in C.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The <code>develop</code> branch contains the in-development version. Stable releases are tagged.</p>
<p>Documentation is built from the LaTeX file <code>bn.tex</code>. There is also limited documentation in <code>tommath.h</code>. There is also a document, <code>tommath.pdf</code>, which describes the goals of the project and many of the algorithms used.</p>
<p>The project can be build by using <code>make</code>. Along with the usual <code>make</code>, <code>make clean</code> and <code>make install</code>, there are several other build targets, see the makefile for details. There are also makefiles for certain specific platforms.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>Tests are located in <code>demo/</code> and can be built in two flavors. * <code>make test</code> creates a test binary that is intended to be run against <code>mtest</code>. <code>mtest</code> can be built with <code>make mtest</code> and test execution is done like <code>./mtest/mtest | ./test</code>. <code>mtest</code> is creating test vectors using an alternative MPI library and <code>test</code> is consuming these vectors to verify correct behavior of ltm * <code>make test_standalone</code> creates a stand-alone test binary that executes several test routines.</p>
