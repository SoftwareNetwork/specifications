<p>libtorrent is an open source C++ library implementing the BitTorrent protocol, along with most popular extensions, making it suitable for real world deployment. It is configurable to be able to fit both servers and embedded devices.</p>
<p>The main goals of libtorrent are to be efficient and easy to use.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://libtorrent.org">libtorrent.org</a> for more detailed build and usage instructions.</p>
<p>To build with boost-build, make sure boost and boost-build is installed and run:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>b2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the libtorrent root. To build the examples, run <code>b2</code> in the <code>examples</code> directory.</p>
<p>See <a href="docs/building.rst">building.html</a> for more details on how to build and which configuration options are available. For python bindings, see <a href="docs/python_binding.rst">the python docs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pull-request-checklist">pull request checklist</h2>
<p>When creating a pull request, please consider the following checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li>make sure both travis-CI and appveyor builds are green. Note that on gcc and clang warnings are treated as errors. Some tests may be flapping, if so, please issue a rebuild of the specific build configuration. (I'm working on making all tests deterministic)</li>
<li>If adding a user-facing feature, please add brief entry to <code>ChangeLog</code></li>
<li>Add a unit test to confirm the new behavior or feature. Don't forget negative tests (i.e. failure cases) and please pay as much care to tests as you would production code.</li>
<li>rebase on top of master periodically</li>
<li>if your patch is against the current stable release branch, please also forward-port the patch to master (at the time of this writing, automatic merge in git does not work, possibly because the branch was created in svn)</li>
<li>if your patch adds a new .cpp file, please make sure it's added to the appropriate <code>Jamfile</code>, <code>Makefile.am</code> and <code>CMakeList.txt</code>. If it's adding a header file, make sure it's added to <code>include/libtorrent/Makefile.am</code>.</li>
</ul>
