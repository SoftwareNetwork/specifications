<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The entity-component-system (also known as <em>ECS</em>) is an architectural pattern used mostly in game development. For further details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://entity-systems.wikidot.com/">Entity Systems Wiki</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cowboyprogramming.com/2007/01/05/evolve-your-heirachy/">Evolve Your Hierarchy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system">ECS on Wikipedia</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This project started off as a pure entity-component system. Over time the codebase has grown as more and more classes and functionalities were added.<br/> Here is a brief, yet incomplete list of what it offers today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Statically generated integer <strong>identifiers</strong> for types (assigned either at compile-time or at runtime).</li>
<li>A <code>constexpr</code> utility for human readable <strong>resource names</strong>.</li>
<li>A minimal <strong>configuration system</strong> built using the monostate pattern.</li>
<li>An incredibly fast <strong>entity-component system</strong> based on sparse sets, with its own <em>pay for what you use</em> policy to adjust performance and memory usage according to the users' requirements.</li>
<li>Views and groups to iterate entities and components and allow different access patterns, from <strong>perfect SoA</strong> to fully random.</li>
<li>A lot of <strong>facilities</strong> built on top of the entity-component system to help the users and avoid reinventing the wheel (dependencies, snapshot, actor class, support for <strong>reactive systems</strong> and so on).</li>
<li>The smallest and most basic implementation of a <strong>service locator</strong> ever seen.</li>
<li>A built-in, non-intrusive and macro-free runtime <strong>reflection system</strong>.</li>
<li>A <strong>cooperative scheduler</strong> for processes of any type.</li>
<li>All that is needed for <strong>resource management</strong> (cache, loaders, handles).</li>
<li>Delegates, <strong>signal handlers</strong> (with built-in support for collectors) and a tiny event dispatcher for immediate and delayed events to integrate in loops.</li>
<li>A general purpose <strong>event emitter</strong> as a CRTP idiom based class template.</li>
<li>And <strong>much more</strong>! Check out the <a href="https://github.com/skypjack/entt/wiki"><strong>wiki</strong></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider this list a work in progress as well as the project. The whole API is fully documented in-code for those who are brave enough to read it.</p>
<p>Currently, <code>EnTT</code> is tested on Linux, Microsoft Windows and OSX. It has proven to work also on both Android and iOS.<br/> Most likely it won't be problematic on other systems as well, but it hasn't been sufficiently tested so far.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I started developing <code>EnTT</code> for the <em>wrong</em> reason: my goal was to design an entity-component system to beat another well known open source solution both in terms of performance and possibly memory usage.<br/> In the end, I did it, but it wasn't very satisfying. Actually it wasn't satisfying at all. The fastest and nothing more, fairly little indeed. When I realized it, I tried hard to keep intact the great performance of <code>EnTT</code> and to add all the features I wanted to see in <em>my own library</em> at the same time.</p>
<p>Nowadays, <code>EnTT</code> is finally what I was looking for: still faster than its <em>competitors</em>, lower memory usage in the average case, a really good API and an amazing set of features. And even more, of course.</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>The proposed entity-component system is incredibly fast to iterate entities and components, this is a fact. Some compilers make a lot of optimizations because of how <code>EnTT</code> works, some others aren't that good. In general, if we consider real world cases, <code>EnTT</code> is somewhere between a bit and much faster than many of the other solutions around, although I couldn't check them all for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>If you are interested, you can compile the <code>benchmark</code> test in release mode (to enable compiler optimizations, otherwise it would make little sense) by setting the <code>BUILD_BENCHMARK</code> option of <code>CMake</code> to <code>ON</code>, then evaluate yourself whether you're satisfied with the results or not.</p>
<p>Honestly I got tired of updating the README file whenever there is an improvement.<br/> There are already a lot of projects out there that use <code>EnTT</code> as a basis for comparison (this should already tell you a lot). Many of these benchmarks are completely wrong, many others are simply incomplete, good at omitting some information and using the wrong function to compare a given feature. Certainly there are also good ones but they age quickly if nobody updates them, especially when the library they are dealing with is actively developed.</p>
<p>The choice to use <code>EnTT</code> should be based on its carefully designed API, its set of features and the general performance, <strong>not</strong> because some single benchmark shows it to be the fastest tool available.</p>
<p>In the future I'll likely try to get even better performance while still adding new features, mainly for fun.<br/> If you want to contribute and/or have suggestions, feel free to make a PR or open an issue to discuss your idea.</p>
<h1 id="build-instructions">Build Instructions</h1>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>To be able to use <code>EnTT</code>, users must provide a full-featured compiler that supports at least C++17.<br/> The requirements below are mandatory to compile the tests and to extract the documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CMake</code> version 3.2 or later.</li>
<li><code>Doxygen</code> version 1.8 or later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, <code>Bazel</code> is also supported as a build system (credits to <a href="https://github.com/zaucy">zaucy</a> who introduced what's required with <a href="https://github.com/skypjack/entt/pull/291">this</a> pull request and offered to maintain it).<br/> In the documentation below I'll still refer to <code>CMake</code>, this being the official build system of the library.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a C++14 version of <code>EnTT</code>, check out the git tag <code>cpp14</code>.</p>
<h2 id="library">Library</h2>
<p><code>EnTT</code> is a header-only library. This means that including the <code>entt.hpp</code> header is enough to include the library as a whole and use it. For those who are interested only in the entity-component system, consider to include the sole <code>entity/registry.hpp</code> header instead.<br/> It's a matter of adding the following line to the top of a file:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span class="pp">#include </span><span class="im">&lt;entt/entt.hpp&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Use the line below to include only the entity-component system instead:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span class="pp">#include </span><span class="im">&lt;entt/entity/registry.hpp&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then pass the proper <code>-I</code> argument to the compiler to add the <code>src</code> directory to the include paths.</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>The documentation is based on <a href="http://www.doxygen.nl/">doxygen</a>. To build it:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DBUILD_DOCS=ON
$ make</code></pre>
<p>The API reference will be created in HTML format within the directory <code>build/docs/html</code>. To navigate it with your favorite browser:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd build
$ your_favorite_browser docs/html/index.html</code></pre>
<!--
@cond TURN_OFF_DOXYGEN
-->
<p>It's also available <a href="https://skypjack.github.io/entt/">online</a> for the latest version.<br/> Finally, there exists a <a href="https://github.com/skypjack/entt/wiki">wiki</a> dedicated to the project where users can find all related documentation pages. <!--
@endcond TURN_OFF_DOXYGEN
--></p>
<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>
<p>To compile and run the tests, <code>EnTT</code> requires <em>googletest</em>.<br/> <code>cmake</code> will download and compile the library before compiling anything else. In order to build the tests, set the CMake option <code>BUILD_TESTING</code> to <code>ON</code>.</p>
<p>To build the most basic set of tests:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$ cd build</code></li>
<li><code>$ cmake -DBUILD_TESTING=ON ..</code></li>
<li><code>$ make</code></li>
<li><code>$ make test</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that benchmarks are not part of this set.</p>
<h1 id="packaging-tools">Packaging Tools</h1>
<p><code>EnTT</code> is available for some of the most known packaging tools. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://bintray.com/skypjack/conan/entt%3Askypjack/_latestVersion"><code>Conan</code></a>, the C/C++ Package Manager for Developers.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/entt"><code>vcpkg</code></a>, Microsoft VC++ Packaging Tool.<br/> You can download and install <code>EnTT</code> in just a few simple steps:</p></li>

<h1 id="entt-in-action">EnTT in Action</h1>
<p><code>EnTT</code> is widely used in private and commercial applications. I cannot even mention most of them because of some signatures I put on some documents time ago. Fortunately, there are also people who took the time to implement open source projects based on <code>EnTT</code> and did not hold back when it came to documenting them.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/skypjack/entt/wiki/EnTT-in-Action">Here</a> you can find an incomplete list of games, applications and articles that can be used as a reference.</p>
<p>If you know of other resources out there that are about <code>EnTT</code>, feel free to open an issue or a PR and I'll be glad to add them to the list.</p>
<h1 id="contributors">Contributors</h1>
<p><code>EnTT</code> was written initially as a faster alternative to other well known and open source entity-component systems. Nowadays this library is moving its first steps. Much more will come in the future and hopefully I'm going to work on it for a long time.<br/> Requests for features, PR, suggestions ad feedback are highly appreciated.</p>
<p>If you find you can help me and want to contribute to the project with your experience or you do want to get part of the project for some other reasons, feel free to contact me directly (you can find the mail in the <a href="https://github.com/skypjack">profile</a>).<br/> I can't promise that each and every contribution will be accepted, but I can assure that I'll do my best to take them all seriously.</p>
