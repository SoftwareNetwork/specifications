<p>Suggested setup for testing: Checkout ghostpdl and mupdf into the same directory. Inside ghostpdl: ln -s ../mupdf/thirdparty/extract extract</p>
<pre><code>Then either:
    Inside ghostpdl:
        ./autogen.sh --with-extract-dir=extract
        make -j 8 debug DEBUGDIRPREFIX=debug-extract-
    Inside mupdf:
        make -j 8 debug
or:
    make test-rebuild-dependent-binaries (for the first time)
make test-build-dependent-binaries (for incremental builds)


Then build and run tests from inside mupdf/thirdparty/extract
as below.</code></pre>
<p>Build and run tests with: make</p>
<p>Conventions:</p>
<pre><code>Errors:

    Functions return zero on success or -1 with errno set.

Identifier/symbol names:

    All identifiers that can be seen by client code (generally things
    defined in include/) start with &#39;extract_&#39;.
    
    Similarly global symbols in generated .o files all start with
    &#39;extract_&#39;; this is tested by target &#39;test-obj&#39;.

    Other identifiers and symbols do not have an &#39;extract_&#39; prefix - not
    necessary because client code cannot see these names.
    
    Header names in include/ start with &#39;extract_&#39;.

Allocation:

    Functions that free a data structure generally take a double pointer
    so that they can set the pointer to NULL before returning, which helps
    avoid stray invalid non-NULL pointers. E.g.:

        extract_span_free(extract_alloc_t* alloc, span_t** pspan);
        /* Frees a span_t, returning with *pspan set to NULL. */

    This double-pointer approach is also used for raw allocation - see
    include/extract_alloc.h.

Lists:
    Lists of data items are generally implemented using an array of
    pointers and an int &#39;foo_num&#39; entry, e.g.:

        line_t**    lines;
        int         lines_num;</code></pre>
