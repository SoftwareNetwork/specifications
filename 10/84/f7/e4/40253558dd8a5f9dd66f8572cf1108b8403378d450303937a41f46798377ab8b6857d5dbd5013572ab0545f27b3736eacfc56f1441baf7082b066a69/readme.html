<h2 id="sqlcipher">SQLCipher</h2>
<p>SQLCipher is a standalone fork of the <a
href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> database library that adds 256
bit AES encryption of database files and other security features
like:</p>
<ul>
<li>on-the-fly encryption</li>
<li>tamper detection</li>
<li>memory sanitization</li>
<li>strong key derivation</li>
</ul>
<p>SQLCipher is based on SQLite and stable upstream release features are
periodically integrated. While SQLCipher is maintained as a separate
version of the source tree, the project minimizes alterations to core
SQLite code whenever possible.</p>
<p>SQLCipher is maintained by Zetetic, LLC, and additional information
and documentation is available on the official <a
href="https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/">SQLCipher site</a>.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fast performance with as little as 5-15% overhead for encryption on
many operations</li>
<li>100% of data in the database file is encrypted</li>
<li>Good security practices (CBC mode, HMAC, key derivation)</li>
<li>Zero-configuration and application level cryptography</li>
<li>Support for multiple cryptographic providers</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>SQLCipher maintains database format compatibility within the same
major version number so an application on any platform can open
databases created by any other application provided the major version of
SQLCipher is the same between them. However, major version updates
(e.g. from 3.x to 4.x) often include changes to default settings. This
means that newer major versions of SQLCipher will not open databases
created by older versions without using special settings. For example,
SQLCipher 4 introduces many new performance and security enhancements.
The new default algorithms, increased KDF iterations, and larger page
size mean that SQLCipher 4 will not open databases created by SQLCipher
1.x, 2.x, or 3.x by default. Instead, an application would either need
to migrate the older databases to use the new format or enable a special
backwards-compatibility mode. The available options are described in
SQLCipher’s <a
href="https://discuss.zetetic.net/t/upgrading-to-sqlcipher-4/3283">upgrade
documentation</a>.</p>
<p>SQLCipher is also compatible with standard SQLite databases. When a
key is not provided, SQLCipher will behave just like the standard SQLite
library. It is also possible to convert from a plaintext database
(standard SQLite) to an encrypted SQLCipher database using <a
href="https://discuss.zetetic.net/t/how-to-encrypt-a-plaintext-sqlite-database-to-use-sqlcipher-and-avoid-file-is-encrypted-or-is-not-a-database-errors/868">ATTACH
and the sqlcipher_export() convenience function</a>.</p>
<h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2>
<p>The SQLCipher team welcomes contributions to the core library. All
contributions including pull requests and patches should be based on the
<code>prerelease</code> branch, and must be accompanied by a <a
href="https://www.zetetic.net/contributions/">contributor agreement</a>.
We strongly encourage <a
href="https://discuss.zetetic.net/c/sqlcipher">discussion</a> of the
proposed change prior to development and submission.</p>
<h2 id="compiling">Compiling</h2>
<p>Building SQLCipher is similar to compiling a regular version of
SQLite from source, with a few small exceptions. You must:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>define <code>SQLITE_HAS_CODEC</code></li>
<li>define <code>SQLITE_TEMP_STORE=2</code> or
<code>SQLITE_TEMP_STORE=3</code> (or use <code>configure</code>’s
–with-tempstore=yes option)</li>
<li>define <code>SQLITE_EXTRA_INIT=sqlcipher_extra_init</code> and
<code>SQLITE_EXTRA_SHUTDOWN=sqlcipher_extra_shutdown</code></li>
<li>define <code>SQLITE_THREADSAFE</code> to <code>1</code> or
<code>2</code> (enabled automatically by <code>configure</code>)</li>
<li>compile and link with a supported cryptographic provider (OpenSSL,
LibTomCrypt, CommonCrypto/Security.framework, or NSS)</li>
</ol>
<p>The following examples demonstrate use of OpenSSL, which is a readily
available provider on most Unix-like systems. Note that, in this
example, <code>--with-tempstore=yes</code> is setting
<code>SQLITE_TEMP_STORE=2</code> for the build, and
<code>SQLITE_THREADSAFE</code> has a default value of
<code>1</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ ./configure --with-tempstore=yes CFLAGS=&quot;-DSQLITE_HAS_CODEC -DSQLITE_EXTRA_INIT=sqlcipher_extra_init -DSQLITE_EXTRA_SHUTDOWN=sqlcipher_extra_shutdown&quot; \
    LDFLAGS=&quot;-lcrypto&quot;
$ make</code></pre>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>The full SQLite test suite will not complete successfully when using
SQLCipher. In some cases encryption interferes with low-level tests that
require access to database file data or features which are unsupported
by SQLCipher. Those tests that are intended to support encryption are
intended for non-SQLCipher implementations. In addition, because SQLite
tests are not always isolated, if one test fails it can trigger a domino
effect with other failures in later steps.</p>
<p>As a result, the SQLCipher package includes it’s own independent
tests that exercise and verify the core functionality of the SQLCipher
extensions. This test suite is intended to provide an abbreviated
verification of SQLCipher’s internal logic; it does not perform an
exhaustive test of the SQLite database system as a whole or verify
functionality on specific platforms. Because SQLCipher is based on
stable upstream builds of SQLite, it is considered a basic assumption
that the core SQLite library code is operating properly (the SQLite core
is almost untouched in SQLCipher). Thus, the additional
SQLCipher-specific test provide the requisite verification that the
library is operating as expected with SQLCipher’s security features
enabled.</p>
<p>To run SQLCipher specific tests, configure as described here and run
the following to execute the tests and receive a report of the
results:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./configure --with-tempstore=yes --enable-fts5 CFLAGS=&quot;-DSQLITE_HAS_CODEC -DSQLITE_EXTRA_INIT=sqlcipher_extra_init -DSQLITE_EXTRA_SHUTDOWN=sqlcipher_extra_shutdown -DSQLCIPHER_TEST&quot; \
    LDFLAGS=&quot;-lcrypto&quot;
$ make testfixture
$ ./testfixture test/sqlcipher.test</code></pre>
<h2 id="encrypting-a-database">Encrypting a database</h2>
<p>To specify an encryption passphrase for the database via the SQL
interface you use a PRAGMA. The passphrase you enter is passed through
PBKDF2 key derivation to obtain the encryption key for the database</p>
<pre><code>PRAGMA key = &#39;passphrase&#39;;</code></pre>
<p>Alternately, you can specify an exact byte sequence using a blob
literal. If you use this method it is your responsibility to ensure that
the data you provide is a 64 character hex string, which will be
converted directly to 32 bytes (256 bits) of key data without key
derivation.</p>
<pre><code>PRAGMA key = &quot;x&#39;2DD29CA851E7B56E4697B0E1F08507293D761A05CE4D1B628663F411A8086D99&#39;&quot;;</code></pre>
<p>To encrypt a database programmatically you can use the
<code>sqlite3_key</code> function. The data provided in
<code>pKey</code> is converted to an encryption key according to the
same rules as <code>PRAGMA key</code>.</p>
<pre><code>int sqlite3_key(sqlite3 *db, const void *pKey, int nKey);</code></pre>
<p><code>PRAGMA key</code> or <code>sqlite3_key</code> should be called
as the first operation when a database is open.</p>
<h2 id="changing-a-database-key">Changing a database key</h2>
<p>To change the encryption passphrase for an existing database you may
use the rekey PRAGMA after you’ve supplied the correct database
password;</p>
<pre><code>PRAGMA key = &#39;passphrase&#39;; -- start with the existing database passphrase
PRAGMA rekey = &#39;new-passphrase&#39;; -- rekey will reencrypt with the new passphrase</code></pre>
<p>The hex rekey pragma may be used to rekey to a specific binary
value</p>
<pre><code>PRAGMA rekey = &quot;x&#39;2DD29CA851E7B56E4697B0E1F08507293D761A05CE4D1B628663F411A8086D99&#39;&quot;;</code></pre>
<p>This can be accomplished programmatically by using sqlite3_rekey;</p>
<pre><code>sqlite3_rekey(sqlite3 *db, const void *pKey, int nKey)</code></pre>

SQLite Source Repository
</h1>
<p>This repository contains the complete source code for the <a
href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite database engine</a>, including many
test scripts. However, other test scripts and most of the documentation
are managed separately.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://sqlite.org/">on-line documentation</a> for
more information about what SQLite is and how it works from a user’s
perspective. This README file is about the source code that goes into
building SQLite, not about how SQLite is used.</p>
<h2 id="version-control">Version Control</h2>
<p>SQLite sources are managed using <a
href="https://fossil-scm.org/">Fossil</a>, a distributed version control
system that was specifically designed and written to support SQLite
development. The <a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline">Fossil
repository</a> contains the urtext.</p>
<p>If you are reading this on GitHub or some other Git repository or
service, then you are looking at a mirror. The names of check-ins and
other artifacts in a Git mirror are different from the official names
for those objects. The official names for check-ins are found in a
footer on the check-in comment for authorized mirrors. The official
check-in name can also be seen in the <code>manifest.uuid</code> file in
the root of the tree. Always use the official name, not the Git-name,
when communicating about an SQLite check-in.</p>
<p>If you pulled your SQLite source code from a secondary source and
want to verify its integrity, there are hints on how to do that in the
<a href="#vauth">Verifying Code Authenticity</a> section below.</p>
<h2 id="contacting-the-sqlite-developers">Contacting The SQLite
Developers</h2>
<p>The preferred way to ask questions or make comments about SQLite or
to report bugs against SQLite is to visit the <a
href="https://sqlite.org/forum">SQLite Forum</a> at <a
href="https://sqlite.org/forum/"
class="uri">https://sqlite.org/forum/</a>. Anonymous postings are
permitted.</p>
<p>If you think you have found a bug that has security implications and
you do not want to report it on the public forum, you can send a private
email to drh at sqlite dot org.</p>
<h2 id="public-domain">Public Domain</h2>
<p>The SQLite source code is in the public domain. See <a
href="https://sqlite.org/copyright.html"
class="uri">https://sqlite.org/copyright.html</a> for details.</p>
<p>Because SQLite is in the public domain, we do not normally accept
pull requests, because if we did take a pull request, the changes in
that pull request might carry a copyright and the SQLite source code
would then no longer be fully in the public domain.</p>
<h2 id="obtaining-the-sqlite-source-code">Obtaining The SQLite Source
Code</h2>
<p>If you do not want to use Fossil, you can download tarballs or ZIP
archives or <a href="https://sqlite.org/cli.html#sqlar">SQLite
archives</a> as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Latest trunk check-in as <a
href="https://sqlite.org/src/tarball/sqlite.tar.gz">Tarball</a>, <a
href="https://sqlite.org/src/zip/sqlite.zip">ZIP-archive</a>, or <a
href="https://sqlite.org/src/sqlar/sqlite.sqlar">SQLite-archive</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Latest release as <a
href="https://sqlite.org/src/tarball/sqlite.tar.gz?r=release">Tarball</a>,
<a
href="https://sqlite.org/src/zip/sqlite.zip?r=release">ZIP-archive</a>,
or <a
href="https://sqlite.org/src/sqlar/sqlite.sqlar?r=release">SQLite-archive</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>For other check-ins, substitute an appropriate branch name or tag
or hash prefix in place of “release” in the URLs of the previous bullet.
Or browse the <a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline">timeline</a> to
locate the check-in desired, click on its information page link, then
click on the “Tarball” or “ZIP Archive” links on the information
page.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To access sources directly using <a
href="https://fossil-scm.org/home">Fossil</a>, first install Fossil
version 2.0 or later. Source tarballs and precompiled binaries available
at <a href="https://fossil-scm.org/home/uv/download.html"
class="uri">https://fossil-scm.org/home/uv/download.html</a>. Fossil is
a stand-alone program. To install, simply download or build the single
executable file and put that file someplace on your $PATH. Then run
commands like this:</p>
<pre><code>    mkdir -p ~/sqlite
    cd ~/sqlite
    fossil open https://sqlite.org/src</code></pre>
<p>The “fossil open” command will take two or three minutes. Afterwards,
you can do fast, bandwidth-efficient updates to the whatever versions of
SQLite you like. Some examples:</p>
<pre><code>    fossil update trunk             ;# latest trunk check-in
    fossil update release           ;# latest official release
    fossil update trunk:2024-01-01  ;# First trunk check-in after 2024-01-01
    fossil update version-3.39.0    ;# Version 3.39.0</code></pre>
<p>Or type “fossil ui” to get a web-based user interface.</p>
<h2 id="compiling-for-unix-like-systems">Compiling for Unix-like
systems</h2>
<p>First create a directory in which to place the build products. It is
recommended, but not required, that the build directory be separate from
the source directory. Cd into the build directory and then from the
build directory run the configure script found at the root of the source
tree. Then run “make”.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>    apt install gcc make tcl-dev  ;#  Make sure you have all the necessary build tools
    tar xzf sqlite.tar.gz         ;#  Unpack the source tree into &quot;sqlite&quot;
    mkdir bld                     ;#  Build will occur in a sibling directory
    cd bld                        ;#  Change to the build directory
    ../sqlite/configure           ;#  Run the configure script
    make sqlite3                  ;#  Builds the &quot;sqlite3&quot; command-line tool
    make sqlite3.c                ;#  Build the &quot;amalgamation&quot; source file
    make sqldiff                  ;#  Builds the &quot;sqldiff&quot; command-line tool
    # Makefile targets below this point require tcl-dev
    make tclextension-install     ;#  Build and install the SQLite TCL extension
    make devtest                  ;#  Run development tests
    make releasetest              ;#  Run full release tests
    make sqlite3_analyzer         ;#  Builds the &quot;sqlite3_analyzer&quot; tool</code></pre>
<p>See the makefile for additional targets. For debugging builds, the
core developers typically run “configure” with options like this:</p>
<pre><code>    ../sqlite/configure --enable-all --enable-debug CFLAGS=&#39;-O0 -g&#39;</code></pre>
<p>For release builds, the core developers usually do:</p>
<pre><code>    ../sqlite/configure --enable-all</code></pre>
<p>Almost all makefile targets require a “tclsh” TCL interpreter version
8.6 or later. The “tclextension-install” target and the test targets
that follow all require TCL development libraries too. (“apt install
tcl-dev”). It is helpful, but is not required, to install the SQLite TCL
extension (the “tclextension-install” target) prior to running tests.
The “releasetest” target has additional requirements, such as
“valgrind”.</p>
<p>On “make” command-lines, one can add “OPTIONS=…” to specify
additional compile-time options over and above those set by ./configure.
For example, to compile with the SQLITE_OMIT_DEPRECATED compile-time
option, one could say:</p>
<pre><code>    ./configure --enable-all
    make OPTIONS=-DSQLITE_OMIT_DEPRECATED sqlite3</code></pre>
<p>The configure script uses autoconf 2.61 and libtool. If the configure
script does not work out for you, there is a generic makefile named
“Makefile.linux-gcc” in the top directory of the source tree that you
can copy and edit to suit your needs. Comments on the generic makefile
show what changes are needed.</p>
<h2 id="compiling-for-windows-using-msvc">Compiling for Windows Using
MSVC</h2>
<p>On Windows, everything can be compiled with MSVC. You will also need
a working installation of TCL. See the <a
href="doc/compile-for-windows.md">compile-for-windows.md</a> document
for additional information about how to install MSVC and TCL and
configure your build environment.</p>
<p>If you want to run tests, you need to let SQLite know the location of
your TCL library, using a command like this:</p>
<pre><code>    set TCLDIR=c:\Tcl</code></pre>
<p>SQLite uses “tclsh.exe” as part of the build process, and so that
program will need to be somewhere on your %PATH%. SQLite itself does not
contain any TCL code, but it does use TCL to help with the build process
and to run tests. You may need to install TCL development libraries in
order to successfully complete some makefile targets. It is helpful, but
is not required, to install the SQLite TCL extension (the
“tclextension-install” target) prior to running tests.</p>
<p>Build using Makefile.msc. Example:</p>
<pre><code>    nmake /f Makefile.msc sqlite3.exe
    nmake /f Makefile.msc sqlite3.c
    nmake /f Makefile.msc sqldiff.exe
    # Makefile targets below this point require TCL development libraries
    nmake /f Makefile.msc tclextension-install
    nmake /f Makefile.msc devtest
    nmake /f Makefile.msc releasetest
    nmake /f Makefile.msc sqlite3_analyzer.exe</code></pre>
<p>There are many other makefile targets. See comments in Makefile.msc
for details.</p>
<p>As with the unix Makefile, the OPTIONS=… argument can be passed on
the nmake command-line to enable new compile-time options. For
example:</p>
<pre><code>    nmake /f Makefile.msc OPTIONS=-DSQLITE_OMIT_DEPRECATED sqlite3.exe</code></pre>
<h2 id="source-tree-map">Source Tree Map</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>src/</strong> - This directory contains the primary
source code for the SQLite core. For historical reasons, C-code used for
testing is also found here. Source files intended for testing begin with
“<code>test</code>”. The <code>tclsqlite3.c</code> and
<code>tclsqlite3.h</code> files are the TCL interface for SQLite and are
also not part of the core.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>test/</strong> - This directory and its subdirectories
contains code used for testing. Files that end in “<code>.test</code>”
are TCL scripts that run tests using an augmented TCL interpreter named
“testfixture”. Use a command like “<code>make testfixture</code>” (unix)
or “<code>nmake /f Makefile.msc testfixture.exe</code>” (windows) to
build that augmented TCL interpreter, then run individual tests using
commands like “<code>testfixture test/main.test</code>”. This test/
subdirectory also contains additional C code modules and scripts for
other kinds of testing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>tool/</strong> - This directory contains programs and
scripts used to build some of the machine-generated code that goes into
the SQLite core, as well as to build and run tests and perform
diagnostics. The source code to <a href="./doc/lemon.html">the Lemon
parser generator</a> is found here. There are also TCL scripts used to
build and/or transform source code files. For example, the
tool/mksqlite3h.tcl script reads the src/sqlite.h.in file and uses it as
a template to construct the deliverable “sqlite3.h” file that defines
the SQLite interface.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ext/</strong> - Various extensions to SQLite are found
under this directory. For example, the FTS5 subsystem is in “ext/fts5/”.
Some of these extensions (ex: FTS3/4, FTS5, RTREE) might get built into
the SQLite amalgamation, but not all of them. The “ext/misc/”
subdirectory contains an assortment of one-file extensions, many of
which are omitted from the SQLite core, but which are included in the <a
href="https://sqlite.org/cli.html">SQLite CLI</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>doc/</strong> - Some documentation files about SQLite
internals are found here. Note, however, that the primary documentation
designed for application developers and users of SQLite is in a
completely separate repository. Note also that the primary API
documentation is derived from specially constructed comments in the
src/sqlite.h.in file.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="generated-source-code-files">Generated Source Code Files</h3>
<p>Several of the C-language source files used by SQLite are generated
from other sources rather than being typed in manually by a programmer.
This section will summarize those automatically-generated files. To
create all of the automatically-generated files, simply run “make
target_source”. The “target_source” make target will create a
subdirectory “tsrc/” and fill it with all the source files needed to
build SQLite, both manually-edited files and automatically-generated
files.</p>
<p>The SQLite interface is defined by the <strong>sqlite3.h</strong>
header file, which is generated from src/sqlite.h.in, ./manifest.uuid,
and ./VERSION. The <a href="https://www.tcl.tk">Tcl script</a> at
tool/mksqlite3h.tcl does the conversion. The manifest.uuid file contains
the SHA3 hash of the particular check-in and is used to generate the
SQLITE_SOURCE_ID macro. The VERSION file contains the current SQLite
version number. The sqlite3.h header is really just a copy of
src/sqlite.h.in with the source-id and version number inserted at just
the right spots. Note that comment text in the sqlite3.h file is used to
generate much of the SQLite API documentation. The Tcl scripts used to
generate that documentation are in a separate source repository.</p>
<p>The SQL language parser is <strong>parse.c</strong> which is
generated from a grammar in the src/parse.y file. The conversion of
“parse.y” into “parse.c” is done by the <a
href="./doc/lemon.html">lemon</a> LALR(1) parser generator. The source
code for lemon is at tool/lemon.c. Lemon uses the tool/lempar.c file as
a template for generating its parser. Lemon also generates the
<strong>parse.h</strong> header file, at the same time it generates
parse.c.</p>
<p>The <strong>opcodes.h</strong> header file contains macros that
define the numbers corresponding to opcodes in the “VDBE” virtual
machine. The opcodes.h file is generated by scanning the src/vdbe.c
source file. The Tcl script at ./mkopcodeh.tcl does this scan and
generates opcodes.h. A second Tcl script, ./mkopcodec.tcl, then scans
opcodes.h to generate the <strong>opcodes.c</strong> source file, which
contains a reverse mapping from opcode-number to opcode-name that is
used for EXPLAIN output.</p>
<p>The <strong>keywordhash.h</strong> header file contains the
definition of a hash table that maps SQL language keywords (ex:
“CREATE”, “SELECT”, “INDEX”, etc.) into the numeric codes used by the
parse.c parser. The keywordhash.h file is generated by a C-language
program at tool mkkeywordhash.c.</p>
<p>The <strong>pragma.h</strong> header file contains various
definitions used to parse and implement the PRAGMA statements. The
header is generated by a script <strong>tool/mkpragmatab.tcl</strong>.
If you want to add a new PRAGMA, edit the
<strong>tool/mkpragmatab.tcl</strong> file to insert the information
needed by the parser for your new PRAGMA, then run the script to
regenerate the <strong>pragma.h</strong> header file.</p>
<h3 id="the-amalgamation">The Amalgamation</h3>
<p>All of the individual C source code and header files (both
manually-edited and automatically-generated) can be combined into a
single big source file <strong>sqlite3.c</strong> called “the
amalgamation”. The amalgamation is the recommended way of using SQLite
in a larger application. Combining all individual source code files into
a single big source code file allows the C compiler to perform more
cross-procedure analysis and generate better code. SQLite runs about 5%
faster when compiled from the amalgamation versus when compiled from
individual source files.</p>
<p>The amalgamation is generated from the tool/mksqlite3c.tcl Tcl
script. First, all of the individual source files must be gathered into
the tsrc/ subdirectory (using the equivalent of “make target_source”)
then the tool/mksqlite3c.tcl script is run to copy them all together in
just the right order while resolving internal “#include” references.</p>
<p>The amalgamation source file is more than 200K lines long. Some
symbolic debuggers (most notably MSVC) are unable to deal with files
longer than 64K lines. To work around this, a separate Tcl script,
tool/split-sqlite3c.tcl, can be run on the amalgamation to break it up
into a single small C file called <strong>sqlite3-all.c</strong> that
does #include on about seven other files named
<strong>sqlite3-1.c</strong>, <strong>sqlite3-2.c</strong>, …,
<strong>sqlite3-7.c</strong>. In this way, all of the source code is
contained within a single translation unit so that the compiler can do
extra cross-procedure optimization, but no individual source file
exceeds 32K lines in length.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-all-fits-together">How It All Fits Together</h2>
<p>SQLite is modular in design. See the <a
href="https://sqlite.org/arch.html">architectural description</a> for
details. Other documents that are useful in helping to understand how
SQLite works include the <a
href="https://sqlite.org/fileformat2.html">file format</a> description,
the <a href="https://sqlite.org/opcode.html">virtual machine</a> that
runs prepared statements, the description of <a
href="https://sqlite.org/atomiccommit.html">how transactions work</a>,
and the <a href="https://sqlite.org/optoverview.html">overview of the
query planner</a>.</p>
<p>Decades of effort have gone into optimizing SQLite, both for small
size and high performance. And optimizations tend to result in complex
code. So there is a lot of complexity in the current SQLite
implementation. It will not be the easiest library in the world to
hack.</p>
<h3 id="key-source-code-files">Key source code files</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>sqlite.h.in</strong> - This file defines the public
interface to the SQLite library. Readers will need to be familiar with
this interface before trying to understand how the library works
internally. This file is really a template that is transformed into the
“sqlite3.h” deliverable using a script invoked by the makefile.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>sqliteInt.h</strong> - this header file defines many of
the data objects used internally by SQLite. In addition to
“sqliteInt.h”, some subsystems inside of sQLite have their own header
files. These internal interfaces are not for use by applications. They
can and do change from one release of SQLite to the next.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>parse.y</strong> - This file describes the LALR(1)
grammar that SQLite uses to parse SQL statements, and the actions that
are taken at each step in the parsing process. The file is processed by
the <a href="./doc/lemon.html">Lemon Parser Generator</a> to produce the
actual C code used for parsing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>vdbe.c</strong> - This file implements the virtual
machine that runs prepared statements. There are various helper files
whose names begin with “vdbe”. The VDBE has access to the vdbeInt.h
header file which defines internal data objects. The rest of SQLite
interacts with the VDBE through an interface defined by vdbe.h.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>where.c</strong> - This file (together with its helper
files named by “where*.c”) analyzes the WHERE clause and generates
virtual machine code to run queries efficiently. This file is sometimes
called the “query optimizer”. It has its own private header file,
whereInt.h, that defines data objects used internally.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>btree.c</strong> - This file contains the implementation
of the B-Tree storage engine used by SQLite. The interface to the rest
of the system is defined by “btree.h”. The “btreeInt.h” header defines
objects used internally by btree.c and not published to the rest of the
system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>pager.c</strong> - This file contains the “pager”
implementation, the module that implements transactions. The “pager.h”
header file defines the interface between pager.c and the rest of the
system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>os_unix.c</strong> and <strong>os_win.c</strong> - These
two files implement the interface between SQLite and the underlying
operating system using the run-time pluggable VFS interface.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>shell.c.in</strong> - This file is not part of the core
SQLite library. This is the file that, when linked against sqlite3.a,
generates the “sqlite3.exe” command-line shell. The “shell.c.in” file is
transformed into “shell.c” as part of the build process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>tclsqlite.c</strong> - This file implements the Tcl
bindings for SQLite. It is not part of the core SQLite library. But as
most of the tests in this repository are written in Tcl, the Tcl
language bindings are important.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>test*.c</strong> - Files in the src/ folder that begin
with “test” go into building the “testfixture.exe” program. The
testfixture.exe program is an enhanced Tcl shell. The testfixture.exe
program runs scripts in the test/ folder to validate the core SQLite
code. The testfixture program (and some other test programs too) is
built and run when you type “make test”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>VERSION</strong>, <strong>manifest</strong>, and
<strong>manifest.uuid</strong> - These files define the current SQLite
version number. The “VERSION” file is human generated, but the
“manifest” and “manifest.uuid” files are automatically generated by the
<a href="https://fossil-scm.org/">Fossil version control
system</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other source files. Each has a succinct header comment
that describes its purpose and role within the larger system.</p>
<p><a name="vauth"></a> ## Verifying Code Authenticity</p>
<p>The <code>manifest</code> file at the root directory of the source
tree contains either a SHA3-256 hash or a SHA1 hash for every source
file in the repository. The name of the version of the entire source
tree is just the SHA3-256 hash of the <code>manifest</code> file itself,
possibly with the last line of that file omitted if the last line begins
with “<code># Remove this line</code>”. The <code>manifest.uuid</code>
file should contain the SHA3-256 hash of the <code>manifest</code> file.
If all of the above hash comparisons are correct, then you can be
confident that your source tree is authentic and unadulterated. Details
on the format for the <code>manifest</code> files are available <a
href="https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/fileformat.wiki#manifest">on
the Fossil website</a>.</p>
<p>The process of checking source code authenticity is automated by the
makefile:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>make verify-source</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or on windows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>nmake /f Makefile.msc verify-source</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using the makefile to verify source integrity is good for detecting
accidental changes to the source tree, but malicious changes could be
hidden by also modifying the makefiles.</p>
