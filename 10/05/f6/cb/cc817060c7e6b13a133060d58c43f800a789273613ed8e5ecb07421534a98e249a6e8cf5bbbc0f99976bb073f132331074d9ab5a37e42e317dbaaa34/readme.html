<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>CMake is a cross-platform, open-source build system generator. For
full documentation visit the <a href="https://cmake.org">CMake Home
Page</a> and the <a href="https://cmake.org/documentation">CMake
Documentation Page</a>. The <a
href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/home">CMake
Community Wiki</a> also references useful guides and recipes.</p>
<p>CMake is maintained and supported by <a
href="https://www.kitware.com/cmake">Kitware</a> and developed in
collaboration with a productive community of contributors.</p>
<h2 id="license">License</h2>
<p>CMake is distributed under the OSI-approved BSD 3-clause License. See

<h3 id="supported-platforms">Supported Platforms</h3>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Windows</li>
<li>Apple macOS</li>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>FreeBSD</li>
<li>OpenBSD</li>
<li>Solaris</li>
<li>AIX</li>
</ul>
<p>Other UNIX-like operating systems may work too out of the box, if not
it should not be a major problem to port CMake to this platform. Please
post to the <a href="https://discourse.cmake.org">CMake Discourse
Forum</a> to ask if others have had experience with the platform.</p>

<h4 id="unixmac-osxmingwmsyscygwin">UNIX/Mac OSX/MinGW/MSYS/Cygwin</h4>
<p>You need to have a C++ compiler (supporting C++11) and a
<code>make</code> installed. Run the <code>bootstrap</code> script you
find in the source directory of CMake. You can use the
<code>--help</code> option to see the supported options. You may use the
<code>--prefix=&lt;install_prefix&gt;</code> option to specify a custom
installation directory for CMake. Once this has finished successfully,
run <code>make</code> and <code>make install</code>.</p>
<p>For example, if you simply want to build and install CMake from
source, you can build directly in the source tree:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./bootstrap &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install</code></pre>
<p>Or, if you plan to develop CMake or otherwise run the test suite,
create a separate build tree:</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build
$ ../bootstrap &amp;&amp; make</code></pre>
<h4 id="windows">Windows</h4>
<p>There are two ways for building CMake under Windows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Compile with MSVC from VS 2015 or later. You need to download and
install a binary release of CMake. You can get these releases from the
<a href="https://cmake.org/download">CMake Download Page</a>. Then
proceed with the instructions below for <a
href="#building-cmake-with-cmake">Building CMake with
CMake</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Bootstrap with MinGW under MSYS2. Download and install <a
href="https://www.msys2.org/">MSYS2</a>. Then install the required build
tools:</p>
<pre><code>$ pacman -S --needed git base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc</code></pre>
<p>and bootstrap as above.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="building-cmake-with-cmake">Building CMake with CMake</h3>
<p>You can build CMake as any other project with a CMake-based build
system: run the installed CMake on the sources of this CMake with your
preferred options and generators. Then build it and install it. For
instructions how to do this, see documentation on <a
href="https://cmake.org/runningcmake">Running CMake</a>.</p>
<p>To build the documentation, install <a
href="https://sphinx-doc.org">Sphinx</a> and configure CMake with
<code>-DSPHINX_HTML=ON</code> and/or <code>-DSPHINX_MAN=ON</code> to
enable the "html" or "man" builder. Add
<code>-DSPHINX_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/sphinx-build</code> if the tool is
not found automatically.</p>
