<p>== Opus audio codec ==</p>
<p>Opus is a codec for interactive speech and audio transmission over the Internet.</p>
<p>  Opus can handle a wide range of interactive audio applications, including
Voice over IP, videoconferencing, in-game  chat, and even remote live music
performances. It can scale from low bit-rate narrowband speech to very high
quality stereo music.</p>
<p>  Opus, when coupled with an appropriate container format, is also suitable
for non-realtime  stored-file applications such as music distribution, game
soundtracks, portable music players, jukeboxes, and other applications that
have historically used high latency formats such as MP3, AAC, or Vorbis.</p>
<pre><code>                Opus is specified by IETF RFC 6716:
                https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6716</code></pre><p>  The Opus format and this implementation of it are subject to the royalty-
free patent and copyright licenses specified in the file COPYING.</p>
<p>This package implements a shared library for encoding and decoding raw Opus
bitstreams. Raw Opus bitstreams should be used over RTP according to
 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7587">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7587</a></p>
<p>The package also includes a number of test  tools used for testing the
correct operation of the library. The bitstreams read/written by these
tools should not be used for Opus file distribution: They include
additional debugging data and cannot support seeking.</p>
<p>Opus stored in files should use the Ogg encapsulation for Opus which is
described at:
 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7845">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7845</a></p>
<p>An opus-tools package is available which provides encoding and decoding of
Ogg encapsulated Opus files and includes a number of useful features.</p>
<p>Opus-tools can be found at:
 <a href="https://git.xiph.org/?p=opus-tools.git">https://git.xiph.org/?p=opus-tools.git</a>

<p>== Compiling libopus ==</p>
<p>To build from a distribution tarball, you only need to do the following:</p>
<pre><code>% ./configure
% make</code></pre><p>To build from the git repository, the following steps are necessary:</p>
<p>0) Set up a development environment:</p>
<p>On an Ubuntu or Debian family Linux distribution:</p>
<pre><code>% sudo apt-get install git autoconf automake libtool gcc make</code></pre><p>On a Fedora/Redhat based Linux:</p>
<pre><code>% sudo dnf install git autoconf automake libtool gcc make</code></pre><p>Or for older Redhat/Centos Linux releases:</p>
<pre><code>% sudo yum install git autoconf automake libtool gcc make</code></pre><p>On Apple macOS, install Xcode and brew.sh, then in the Terminal enter:</p>
<pre><code>% brew install autoconf automake libtool</code></pre><p>1) Clone the repository:</p>
<pre><code>% git clone https://git.xiph.org/opus.git
% cd opus</code></pre><p>2) Compiling the source</p>
<pre><code>% ./autogen.sh
% ./configure
% make</code></pre><p>3) Install the codec libraries (optional)</p>
<pre><code>% sudo make install</code></pre><p>Once you have compiled the codec, there will be a opus_demo executable
in the top directory.</p>
<p>Usage: opus_demo [-e] <application> &lt;sampling rate (Hz)&gt; &lt;channels (1/2)&gt;
         <bits per second> [options] <input> <output>
       opus_demo -d &lt;sampling rate (Hz)&gt; &lt;channels (1/2)&gt; [options]
         <input> <output></p>
<p>mode: voip | audio | restricted-lowdelay
options:
  -e                : only runs the encoder (output the bit-stream)
  -d                : only runs the decoder (reads the bit-stream as input)
  -cbr              : enable constant bitrate; default: variable bitrate
  -cvbr             : enable constrained variable bitrate; default:
                      unconstrained
  -bandwidth &lt;NB|MB|WB|SWB|FB&gt;
                    : audio bandwidth (from narrowband to fullband);
                      default: sampling rate
  -framesize &lt;2.5|5|10|20|40|60&gt;
                    : frame size in ms; default: 20
  -max_payload <bytes>
                    : maximum payload size in bytes, default: 1024
  -complexity <comp>
                    : complexity, 0 (lowest) ... 10 (highest); default: 10
  -inbandfec        : enable SILK inband FEC
  -forcemono        : force mono encoding, even for stereo input
  -dtx              : enable SILK DTX
  -loss <perc>      : simulate packet loss, in percent (0-100); default: 0</p>
<p>input and output are little-endian signed 16-bit PCM files or opus
bitstreams with simple opus_demo proprietary framing.</p>
<p>== Testing ==</p>
<p>This package includes a collection of automated unit and system tests
which SHOULD be run after compiling the package especially the first
time it is run on a new platform.</p>
<p>To run the integrated tests:</p>
<pre><code>% make check</code></pre><p>There is also collection of standard test vectors which are not
included in this package for size reasons but can be obtained from:
<a href="https://opus-codec.org/docs/opus_testvectors-rfc8251.tar.gz">https://opus-codec.org/docs/opus_testvectors-rfc8251.tar.gz</a></p>
<p>To run compare the code to these test vectors:</p>
<pre><code>% curl -OL https://opus-codec.org/docs/opus_testvectors-rfc8251.tar.gz
% tar -zxf opus_testvectors-rfc8251.tar.gz
% ./tests/run_vectors.sh ./ opus_newvectors 48000</code></pre><p>== Portability notes ==</p>
<p>This implementation uses floating-point by default but can be compiled to
use only fixed-point arithmetic by setting --enable-fixed-point (if using
autoconf) or by defining the FIXED_POINT macro (if building manually).
The fixed point implementation has somewhat lower audio quality and is
slower on platforms with fast FPUs, it is normally only used in embedded
environments.</p>
<p>The implementation can be compiled with either a C89 or a C99 compiler.
While it does not rely on any <em>undefined behavior</em> as defined by C89 or
C99, it relies on common <em>implementation-defined behavior</em> for two&#39;s
complement architectures:</p>
<p>o Right shifts of negative values are consistent with two&#39;s
  complement arithmetic, so that a&gt;&gt;b is equivalent to
  floor(a/(2^b)),</p>
<p>o For conversion to a signed integer of N bits, the value is reduced
  modulo 2^N to be within range of the type,</p>
<p>o The result of integer division of a negative value is truncated
  towards zero, and</p>
<p>o The compiler provides a 64-bit integer type (a C99 requirement
  which is supported by most C89 compilers).</p>
