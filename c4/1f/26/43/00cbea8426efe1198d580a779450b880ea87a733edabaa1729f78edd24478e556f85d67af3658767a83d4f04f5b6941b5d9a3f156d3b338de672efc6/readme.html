<p>README for building of Scintilla and SciTE</p>
<p>Scintilla can be built by itself. To build SciTE, Scintilla must first be built.</p>
<p>*** GTK+/Linux version ***</p>
<p>You must first have GTK+ 2.24 or later and GCC (7.1 or better) installed. Clang may be used by adding CLANG=1 to the make command line. Other C++ compilers may work but may require tweaking the make file. Either GTK+ 2.x or 3.x may be used with 2.x the default and 3.x chosen with the make argument GTK3=1.</p>
<p>To build Scintilla, use the makefile located in the scintilla/gtk directory cd scintilla/gtk make cd ../..</p>
<p>To build and install SciTE, use the makefile located in the scite/gtk directory cd scite/gtk make sudo make install</p>
<p>This installs SciTE into $prefix/bin. The value of $prefix is determined from the location of Gnome if it is installed. This is usually /usr if installed with Linux or /usr/local if built from source. If Gnome is not installed /usr/bin is used as the prefix. The prefix can be overridden on the command line like &quot;make prefix=/opt&quot; but the same value should be used for both make and make install as this location is compiled into the executable. The global properties file is installed at $prefix/share/scite/SciTEGlobal.properties. The language specific properties files are also installed into this directory.</p>
<p>To remove SciTE sudo make uninstall</p>
<p>To clean the object files which may be needed to change $prefix make clean</p>
<p>The current make file only supports static linking between SciTE and Scintilla.</p>
<p>*** Windows version ***</p>
<p>A C++ 17 compiler is required. Visual Studio 2017 is the development system used for most development although Mingw-w64 7.1 is also supported.</p>
<p>To build Scintilla, make in the scintilla/win32 directory cd scintilla32 GCC: mingw32-make Visual C++: nmake -f scintilla.mak cd ....</p>
<p>To build SciTE, use the makefiles located in the scite/win32 directory cd scite32 GCC: mingw32-make Visual C++: nmake -f scite.mak</p>
<p>An executable SciTE will now be in scite/bin.</p>
<p>*** GTK+/Windows version ***</p>
<p>Mingw-w64 is known to work. Other compilers will probably not work.</p>
<p>Only Scintilla will build with GTK+ on Windows. SciTE will not work.</p>
<p>To build Scintilla, make in the scintilla/gtk directory cd scintilla mingw32-make</p>
<p>*** macOS Cocoa version ***</p>
<p>Xcode 9.2 or later may be used to build Scintilla on macOS.</p>
<p>There is no open source version of SciTE for macOS but there is a commercial version available through the App Store.</p>
<p>To build Scintilla, run xcodebuild in the scintilla/cocoa/ScintillaFramework directory cd cocoa/ScintillaFramework xcodebuild</p>
<p>*** Qt version ***</p>
<p>See the qt/README file to build Scintilla with Qt.</p>
