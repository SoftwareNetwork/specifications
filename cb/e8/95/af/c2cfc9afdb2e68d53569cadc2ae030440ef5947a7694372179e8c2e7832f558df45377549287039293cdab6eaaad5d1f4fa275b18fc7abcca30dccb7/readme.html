<h2 id="project-description">Project Description</h2>
<p>An optimized implementation of the JPEG-LS standard for lossless and near-lossless image compression. JPEG-LS is a low-complexity standard that matches JPEG 2000 compression ratios. In terms of speed, CharLS outperforms open source and commercial JPEG LS implementations.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>High performance C++ implementation with a C interface to ensure maximum interopability.</li>
<li>Supports Windows, Linux and Solaris in 32 bit and 64 bit.</li>
<li>Includes a wrapper class for .NET</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="about-jpeg-ls">About JPEG-LS</h2>
<p>JPEG-LS (ISO-14495-1/ITU-T.87) is a standard derived from the Hewlett Packard LOCO algorithm. JPEG LS has low complexity (meaning fast compression) and high compression ratios, similar to JPEG 2000. JPEG-LS is more similar to the old Lossless JPEG than to JPEG 2000, but interestingly the two different techniques result in vastly different performance characteristics. <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_JPEG">Wikipedia on lossless JPEG and JPEG-LS</a> <a href="charls.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=JPEG-LS-Performance&amp;referringTitle=Home">Benchmarks JPEG-LS-Performance</a></p>

<h3 id="primary-development">Primary development</h3>
<p>Primary development is done on Windows with Visual Studio 2015. Optimized projects and solution files are available for this environment.</p>
<p>All other platforms are supported by cmake. CMake is a cross platform open source build system that generate projectfiles for a large set of environments.</p>
