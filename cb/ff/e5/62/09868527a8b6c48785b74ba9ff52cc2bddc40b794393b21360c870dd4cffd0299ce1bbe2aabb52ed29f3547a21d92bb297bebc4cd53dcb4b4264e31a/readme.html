<p>This project (double-conversion) provides binary-decimal and decimal-binary routines for IEEE doubles.</p>
<p>The library consists of efficient conversion routines that have been extracted from the V8 JavaScript engine. The code has been refactored and improved so that it can be used more easily in other projects.</p>
<p>There is extensive documentation in <code>double-conversion/double-conversion.h</code>. Other examples can be found in <code>test/cctest/test-conversions.cc</code>.</p>
<h1 id="building">Building</h1>
<p>This library can be built with <a href="http://www.scons.org/">scons</a> or <a href="https://cmake.org/">cmake</a>. The checked-in Makefile simply forwards to scons, and provides a shortcut to run all tests:</p>
<pre><code>make
make test</code></pre>
<h2 id="scons">Scons</h2>
<p>The easiest way to install this library is to use <code>scons</code>. It builds the static and shared library, and is set up to install those at the correct locations:</p>
<pre><code>scons install</code></pre>
<p>Use the <code>DESTDIR</code> option to change the target directory:</p>
<pre><code>scons DESTDIR=alternative_directory install</code></pre>
<h2 id="cmake">Cmake</h2>
<p>To use cmake run <code>cmake .</code> in the root directory. This overwrites the existing Makefile.</p>
<p>Use <code>-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON</code> to enable the compilation of shared libraries. Note that this disables static libraries. There is currently no way to build both libraries at the same time with cmake.</p>
<p>Use <code>-DBUILD_TESTING=ON</code> to build the test executable.</p>
<pre><code>cmake . -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
make
test/cctest/cctest --list | tr -d &#39;&lt;&#39; | xargs test/cctest/cctest</code></pre>
